OpenLCB CBUS library

An attempt to reduce the amount of editing when a change is made or bug fixed by having a library of common stuff.

Currently supports 18F2480, 18F2580 and 18F4580 processors. Processor type P18F2480 or P18F4580 is defined on the compile command line.

It would be nice to use a .lib files with all the object modules, but overlay storage is not allowed in a lib file (although the error message is about the string table when linking).

Separatly compiling and then linking save some insignificant compile time and has lots of extra .o files for each processor type.

Including all the small .c files may be the best way.

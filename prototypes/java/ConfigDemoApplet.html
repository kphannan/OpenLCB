<h1>OpenLCB Configuration Demo</h1>
This page demonstrates one possible form of an OpenLCB configuration tool.

<p>
Press the button at the bottom to start the demonstration. 
(Note:  This may not work on some browsers, particularly Safari, 
depending on security settings; it's known to work on recent Firefox versions)

<p>
The new window has three sections.  If the entire window doesn't fit 
cleanly on the screen, you can minimise one or more of the top sections
by clicking on the little arrow at the top left of the section.
<p>
The top section, labeled "Identification", shows the node identification
information from the OpenLCB node's Configuration Definition Information (CDI)
file.  These are properties of the node, and can't be changed.

<p>
Below that are sections for two "segments" of configuration information.

<p>
Note this that is just a demo. The read/write buttons don't work yet!
Also, we haven't done much work on the cosmetics, so some things will look odd,
the layout on the screen takes too much space, etc.

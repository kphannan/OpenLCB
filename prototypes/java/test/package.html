(This doesn't appear in the JavaDoc, as it's
not in a package directory; it's more for 
people browsing the code)
<p>

for OpenLCB.

Subpackages:
<ul>

<li>tools - tool and simulation implementations
<li>scenarios - test the code by invoking specific scenarios
<li>simulations - Monte-Carlo and event-based simulations of various OpenLCB operations; not tests of operational code
</ul>

DPH Notes.  20090501


Bob has defined a PCE as having: 
  An array of nconsumer consumer events and
              nproducer producer events.  

He has defined the logic for receiving: 
  requests to report all consumed or produced events.
  requests for whether this node consumes an event.
  requests for whether this node produces an event.

If a received event matches a consumer event, then 
a callback is called with the index of the event. 


We still need messages to set consumed, produced, and callbacks.

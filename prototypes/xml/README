Making CDI from JMRI decoder XML:

go over to the prototypes/java directory
edit test/tools/jmri/DecoderDefnToCdi.java to include your file name at the bottom
    (has to be in JMRI, so the rest can be found)
ant tests && ./runtest.csh tools.jmri.DecoderDefnToCdi

Remaining issues
*) Indexed CV handling (lots of types)
*) Write the section on DCC controls from the supported programming modes in decoder file
*) Make I/O, running easy
*) Put out short copyright notice at top for JMRI

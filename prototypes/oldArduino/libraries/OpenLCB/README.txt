OpenLCB library

This is an Arduino library that contains 
a prototype implementation of the OpenLCB
protocol.

Right now, it's a mix of CAN-specific and general items.
See the README.html file for more details.

Note that many of the files are actually Unix symbolic links
to source-code files in the C/C++ prototypes package.

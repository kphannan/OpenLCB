This is a version of the CAN2EthernetServer sketch which
acts as an automatic client, trying to attach to some other
node which is acting as a fixed-address server.

It has not been migrated to Arduino 1.0

Rather than try to get this to work, effort has gone into
a correct mDNS solution, so this sketch has been bypassed.

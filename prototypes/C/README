This directory is still being structured!

Right now, the makefiles are entirely local, but eventually
they'll be moved to a non-recursive make structure.  In the 
meantime, cd to whatever leaf directory and do make there.

  cd src/interface/common
  make check
  

the "check" programs are placeholders that will eventually be removed
in favor of real tests resident in the "test" directory tree.

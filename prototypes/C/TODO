Makefile (esp tests/Makefile) doesn't have a general link rule;

Streams is just a scaffold at present; buffer management needs thought

Datagram interface needs to transfer source ID of received datagrams,

causing the proper ack/nak to be sent & ending the sequence.
Default should actually be "don't know what to do with this"
if all fall through.

Configuration needs code for testing actual read/write response.

17 August 2011:
	* reworked the forward declarations for some of the circular references. Not entirely satisfied, but it compiles
	* totally redid the alias allocation scheme. Still need to run checks of incoming CID/RID against aliases in progress, and aliases in progress against themselves.
	* renamed OLCB_Handler to OLCB_Virtual_Node to make its purpose clearer
	* renamed OLCB_AliasCache to OLCB_Alias_Cache for consistency
  TODO:
	* Update the examples to reflect the changes here.
	* Complete the CID/RID algorithm: Respond to RID frames during alias allocation. Check all generated aliases against other NIDa's currently being allocated and extant Virtual Node instanecs before proceeding with allocation on CAN

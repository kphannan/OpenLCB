//   A 2-channel OpenLCB node for the RailroadShield
//  
// Initial testing showed that having pin 10 active
// caused the program to fail shortly after the link
// was establishing, hanging up entirely.
//
// Note that you have to modify the CAN driver
// around line 42 in libraries/CAN/utility/config.h
// to work with the RailroadShield

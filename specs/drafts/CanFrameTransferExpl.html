CAN Frame Transfer Explanation</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Introduction</H2>
<P>This explanatory note contains informative discussion and
background for the corresponding “OpenLCB CAN Frame Transfer
Specification”. This explanation is not normative in any way.</P>
<P>Have to avoid collisions by design, not by luck.</P>
<P>OpenLCB assumes(?) a global communications fabric: any node can
send a message to any node, and any node can send a message to all
nodes. This document describes how CAN is used to do that.</P>
<P>Cannot (do not assume) one of anything, including node managers,
etc. If you allow for more than zero, it has to be any number.</P>
<P>Fully traceability also assures no collisions.</P>
<P>The adaptations include

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A 1-bit priority field has been
	added to provide a coarse high/low message priority 
	</P>

	bit forms. Those forms are dynamically allocated so as to remain
	unique.

<P>Note that these adaptions must be possible in standard CAN
components, e.g. bridges and computer adapters must not require
customization to operate with OpenLCB. This provides a stringent
requirement on protocol design, in that OpenLCB CAN cannot require
specific timing, deliberate creation of error cases or specific error
handling. 
</P>
<P>The translations include: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The NID Source ID (SID) is mapped to a shorter form, called a
	&quot;NID Alias&quot; (NIDa). The method for this mapping is defined
	such that devices on the CAN segment (e.g. gateways to other parts
	of the larger OpenLCB installation) can determine the full NID that
	corresponds to a particular alias. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because this alias is still unique on

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The CAN format has been allocated on

<H2 CLASS="western">Annotations to the Specification</H2>
<P>This section provides background information on corresponding
sections of the Specification document. It's expected that two
documents will be read together.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<H3 CLASS="western">References and Context</H3>
<H3 CLASS="western">Frame Format</H3>
<P>OpenLCB uses a very vanilla transfer of frames, no special
features, to reduce complexity and increase robustness.</P>
<P>Standard header frames are also known as CAN 2.0A frames. Extended
header frames are also known as CAN 2.0B frames.</P>
<P>The specification is silent on the uses for standard (11-bit
header) frames. The proper-operation require is so nodes tolerate
them in case they're needed for e.g. bootloaders. This could also
have been phrased as “shall ignore ...”, but the current phrasing
is thought to be more exact.</P>
<P>We don't use RTR because CAN semantics require a specific use for
it, which has been built into some silicon implementations. There are
also some arbitration issues, see: CiA Application Note 802 (2005)
and <A HREF="http://www.thecanmancan.com/?tag=rtr">http://www.thecanmancan.com/?tag=rtr</A>
for more information.</P>
<P>The MSB is likely to be used as a priority-boost bit in the
future, e.g. so that a gateway can gain priority access to the CAN
segment for various operations that require synchronization or
atomicity. CAN encodes “do first” priority as 0 and “do later”
as 1, so the specification requires that a 1 bit be sent. To preserve
the utility of this, nodes must not require either a 1 nor 0 on
receipt.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A 1-bit field priority field coarsely specifies the priority
	of the message in terms of CAN arbitration to be high (pri=0) or low
	(pri=1). By default, all messages are to be emitted with low
	priority selected. Receiving nodes must not check this bit.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This field is intended for network
	infrastructure and server type nodes (Command Stations) that may
	from time to time experience high traffic loads and need the ability
	to pre-empt other nodes to forward messages from a busy segment or
	preempt the sending of responses to nodes over receiving new
	requests to prevent message buffer overflow. This field is separate
	from the static priority field in the MTI format specification.</P>

</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Throughput and Temporarily Deaf Nodes</H4>
<P>OpenLCB requires that CAN-attached nodes be able to handle the
full frame rate on the CAN bus. There is no guarantee that frames for
a given node will arrive with non-zero time between then. 
</P>
<P>Some nodes are not always able to process frames. For example, the
node may cease processing for a short time while writing non-volatile
memory. Higher-level protocols, e.g. configuration write datagrams,
have mechanisms built in to prevent overrun while writing
configuration memory, but there could be multiple activities going on
in parallel that will result in frames arriving while the node is not
processing.</P>
<P>Short outages can be covered by CAN hardware buffering, so long as
the node will eventually catch up even at full arrival rate. Outages
long enough that frames are lost due to e.g. buffer overflow require
node to broadcast that it's back up if hardware detected frame lost.
This is because tehre could have been frames of some form that
modified the OpenLCB node state, which are now lost (e.g. drop alias,
CIM/RIM in absence, or even higher level events) 
</P>

for e.g. NVRAM writing.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">On the choice of a 12-bit alias length</H2>
<P>How big should the NodeID alias field be on CAN links?</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Smaller (fewer bits) allows more payload and/or simpler
	coding of other parts of messages. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Larger allows more unique nodes to be accessed.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Issues</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Addressing</H4>
<P>The Node ID size limits the number of unique nodes that can take
part in communications on the CAN segment. Because Node ID aliases
are assigned independently on each CAN segment, the only issue is how
many different nodes are involved, not which ones they are or what
pattern(s) are available in their address numbers.</P>
<P>For electrical/timing reasons, a segment itself can only support a
maximum of about 50 nodes, but communication also involves nodes off
the segment. For example, chaining N CAN segments via bridges will
generally make up to 50*N nodes available. We have a use case of
chaining small numbers of CAN segments together, implying the need to
address 500 or 1000 nodes. 
</P>
<P>As another example, a very large network might connect many CAN
segments via TCP/IP or other networked connections. Each CAN-attached
node might need to communicate with a larger number of others spread
across that network.</P>
<P>(CAN backbone case)</P>
<P>In some cases, want 2 aliases (source and destination), plus a few
more bits, in 29 bits total. 29-(2*12) = 5 is a pretty compelling
choice.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Collisions during Allocation</H4>
<P>(not talking CAN arbitration here, but two nodes trying to use
same alias) The allocation process resolves collisions (attempt to
use an already allocated Node ID alias), but that takes time.
Minimizing the number of collisions is good. If the address space is
just the size of the number of things you want to address, the
collisions get hard /slow to resolve across multiple nodes. This
points to having a factor of 2, at least, between the number of nodes
to be addressed and the size of the address space.</P>
<P>(Mostly talking about separate nodes here, not just one big
interface node: Points to CAN backbone case)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Size</H4>
<P>Reducing size most important (so far) in the stream protocol.</P>
<P>Events and Datagrams can be transmitted with a 16-bit alias size.</P>
<P>To get the full payload (8 bytes) for streaming requires getting
the rest of the protocol control, including two aliases for source
and destination, in the 29 bit header. Allowing 1 bit for
priority/extension, 1 for protocol control, 3 for MTI and stream
control (all very bare minima) leads to a 12-bit node ID alias
length. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Simplicity</H4>
<P>Byte vs nibble vs bit boundaries in code, when debugging the
protocol, etc.</P>
<P>Having extra bits available in the header allows much simpler MTI
coding, reserving specific bits for expansion instead of codes, etc.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Filtering</H4>
<P>Having the destination short enough to be in the header allows
automated filtering of traffic. Nodes must still deal with the full
rate, because messages can always be adjacent in time.</P>

discover they've both arbitrated the same aliases, including with

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">From <META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen"><META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen">Node
ID Alias Allocation Algorithm doc</H2>
<P>OpenLCB nodes on CAN segments do CAN arbitration by using their
unique Node ID alias (NIDa) as part of the CAN header. This page
documents a proposed algorithm for assigning unique Node ID aliases. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<P>This method of assigning aliases and checking that they are unique
is necessary because of the characteristics and limitations oFromf
CAN. 
</P>
<P>Each node has 48-bit unique id, and each wants a 12-bit local
alias. Each assigns itself a potential 12-bit alias. The problem
comes in determining whether this alias is in use by another node. 
</P>
<P>If a node sends out an check message containing just the alias,
then it could expect that another node to complain if it has the same
alias. This would work, except in the (admittedly unlikely) case
where both nodes send out the identical check message simultaneously.
Neither would recognize a conflict and both would consider that they
own the same alias. Therefore, a method needs to be found that
guarantees that the check message(s) are unique, even if they are
sent simultaneously. 
</P>
<P><I>(timing of serialization of low-priority CAN nodes at network
startup)</I></P>
<P><I>(can store starting point, not just alias, for later use)</I></P>
<P>Unfortunately, limitations of CAN will not allow the full 48-bit
NodeID to be included in the check message. Doing so would violate
CAN rules as it could not be wholly contained in the header, and
packets with identical headers are not allowed to have differing
data-parts. 
</P>
<P>Therefore, the CIM/RIM method splits the NodeID into byte-sized
parts, sends out 4 check messages (CIM = Check Id Messages, RIM =
Reserved Id Message), each consisting of the alias and one quarter
(12 bits) of the 48 bit id. Only if all of the CIMs *do not* conflict
with another node (ie no RIM is received) does it guarantee that the
alias is not in use by another node. Even if two nodes send out the
identical packets simultaneously, at least one of these will differ
due to a differing ID-part between the two nodes. 
</P>

	<LI><P>It is desirable to detect duplicate (non-unique) NIDs, but
	100% reliable detection is not required. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Algorithm</H3>
<P>Start with the six-byte unique Node ID in each node, with the
bytes labelled N1 through N6. 
</P>
<P>Initialize a specific full-sequence 48bit PRNG with the 48 Node
ID. 
</P>
<P>A: 
</P>
<P>Take the next element from the PRNG . Derive the 12-bit value for
TCA, the tentative alias. If TCA is zero, repeat.</P>
<P>Start listening for CAN frames containing Check ID messages (CIMs)
and Reserved ID Messages (RIMs). A CIM consists of an extended header
with a 12 bit Source NIDa field, an 3 bit sequence field, a 12-bit
TestN field, and other bits to denote that this is a Check ID
Message. There is no other variable information in the frame. Having
NIDa, Nn and TestN in the message ensure that CAN arbitration will
work without error. An RIM is the same, except that it can be
identified as being a different message for diagnostic purposes; it
means the same thing upon receipt. 
</P>
<P>Send four CIMs with 0 through 3 in the Nn field, the 12-bit
quarters of the NodeID in the TestN field, and TCA in the Source NIDa
field. During this process, if a CIM or RIM is received that contains
the TCA value in its CI field, TCA does not belong to this node.
Repeat from (A). 
</P>
<P>Keep listening until your CAN hardware says your last CIM message
has been sent and the CAN link is idle, plus 500 msec. If you cannot
detect that condition, wait 1 second.</P>
<P>If no CIM or RIM with this TCA value in the CI field is received
before the end of the previous step, you've successfully allocated
TCA as this node's source NIDa. Send an RIM with TCA in the CI field
and go into normal operation. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If that message fails with an error occurring during the data
	portion of the message, it's possible that two nodes have the same
	NodeID, a fatal error. To prevent the OpenLCB being taken down, this
	node should stop trying to allocate an alias and signal the error to
	the user via some non-CAN method, e.g. LEDs, emitting smoke, etc.</P>
	<LI><P>If any other error occurs, repeat from A.</P>
</UL>
<P>While in normal operation, if you receive a CIM with your source
NIDa, send a RIM, which will cause the other node to back off and try
something else. 
</P>
<P>It should not be possible to receive an RIM with your allocated
source NIDa in normal operation. If you do, log an error (on whatever
it is they log it on there) and restart the process at (A). 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Proposed alias derivation</H4>
<P>The 12 bit alias has to be derived from a 48-bit sequence number
in a way that keeps as much entropy as possible.</P>
<P>Sequentially numbered nodes will have initial seeds that differ
only in the low bits of the PRNG output. For shift-register PRNGs,
this can present a problem, as all bytes of the result are shifting
together. Combining bytes (or even 12-bit chunks) via XOR or add
operations results in reduced entropy.</P>
<P>The OpenLCB proposed PRNG (next section) uses add operations with
a constant term to avoid this problem, so treating the 48-bit PRNG
output as four 12-but values, which are then XORed, works well.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Proposed PRNG</H4>
<P>The proposed 48-bit PRNG is from “A 48-Bit Pseudo-Random Number
Generator”, Heidi G. Kuehn, Communications of the ACM, Volume
4,&nbsp;Issue 8 (August 1961), pages 350-352.</P>
<P>x<SUB>i+1</SUB> = (2<SUP>9</SUP>+1) x<SUB>i</SUB> + c</P>
<P>where c = 29,741,096,258,473 or 0x1B0CA37A4BA9.The paper actually
describes a PRNG that uses signed arithmetic, but for our purposes
the 48<SUP>th</SUP> “sign” bit isn't important. <I>(verify that
about sign) (This is a byte+bit shift and add, so it's quick to
calculate)</I></P>
<P>Note that, unlike some other PNRGs, this one can generate a zero
result, and can accept a zero seed.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Discussion</H3>
<P>CAN arbitration reliably avoids collisions between frames with
unique headers. It does not guarantee arbitration between frames with
identical headers and no data; if the timing is right, they may
overlay each other such that only one frame appears to have been
sent. It is very difficult to ensure that two nodes send
initialization packets only at different times. In addition, CAN will
eventually signal an error if two packets with the same header and
different data payloads collide, but not all CAN interface hardware
provides reliable indications about why that error occurred. <I>(lock
step issue at startup)</I></P>
<P>At the highest level, this algorithm is broadcasting the complete
Node ID and tentative alias to see if any other node is checking the
same tentative alias. If two nodes have taken the same tentative
alias, at least one of the four packets used in that broadcast will
not be identical between the two nodes, because their six-byte Node
IDs are different in at least one bit. CAN will successfully
arbitrate this, and the other node will receive the frame, causing it
to back off.</P>
<P>CAN transmissions are not atomic operations; you can receive a
frame between the time you tell the hardware to send a frame and the
time that frame is actually sent. It's therefore possible for both
nodes contending for the same alias value to back off and try again.
Using the pseudo-random number generator as a sequence number makes
it likely that the next attempt will be made using different alias
values in the two nodes. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The use of
the sequence generator also makes the arbitration process faster in
the case of sequential Node ID values. People like to use small and
sequential numbers for things, and the sequence generator maps those
to very different values that are less likely to collide during
arbitration. </SPAN>
</P>
<P>The delays at the end of the algorithm are to ensure that higher
latency nodes, such as software nodes working through USB convertors,
can reply to CID messages from nodes that come up on a working link.
OpenLCB is a soft-real-time system, and software that's interacting
with it needs to have response times of a couple hundred milliseconds
or better to be reliable. The algorithm provides a wait of a few
times that to enable those programs to take part.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Rate, bandwidth and throttling</H3>
<P>29-bit extended header and 8-byte payload results in a total
transmission taking about 135 bit times.</P>
<P>125Kbps with max-length extended header frames is about 900
frames/second. CAN is very good at running at 100% utilization, so
long as nodes can keep up and a proper set of priorities is in place.</P>
<P>CAN is designed to run at 100% usage without problem, and it's
routine for CAN segments in other contexts to run at 100% for
extended times. Therefore, the CAN network does not require any
inter-frame spacing, limitations on bandwidth usage, etc; the segment
can be allowed to run at 100%.</P>
<P>The real limitation is whether the nodes themselves can handle the
full rate of frame arrival. There is (currently) no mechanism in
OpenLCB to throttle the rate of frames arriving at a node, nor is it
easy to create one in a CAN network. The stream and datagram protocol
have been designed to allow a node to efficiently use a very limited
amount of buffer memory, but don't provide mechanisms to limit the
arrival of frames.</P>
<P>For long term reliability, a node <U>must</U> be able to
completely process an entire CAN frame in the time it takes to
receive the next one, which may be as little as 42 (?) bit times.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">CIM/RIM message content and format</H3>
<P>The CIM/RIM algorithm for finding aliases is designed to work
without any CAN errors. Arbitration conflicts are OK, but deliberate
errors are not, because different CAN implementations may deal with
them differently. During execution of the algorithm, some frames
might have the same header. They therefore have to have the same
contents, or else a non-arbitration error can occur.</P>
<P>Although it might be a useful debugging tool, putting the full NID
in the data portion of the frames can cause errors. Therefore, we
decided not to do that.</P>

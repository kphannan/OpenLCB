CAN Frame Transfer Explanation</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Introduction</H2>
<P>This explanatory note contains informative discussion and
background for the corresponding “OpenLCB CAN Frame Transfer
Specification”. This explanation is not normative in any way.</P>
<P>The Frame Transfer layer of the OpenLCB-CAN stack likes above the
CAN Physical Layer, and below the Message Network layer. It is
responsible for ensuring the reliable transport of the CAN frames
that make up OpenLCB-CAN messages. CAN provides reliable transport
between any two nodes on a CAN segment within limitations:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Every CAN header must be unique by construction. Collisions
	between frames with identical headers do not result in well-defined
	behavior, and must be avoided by design to avoid intermittent
	problems.</P>
	<LI><P>CAN does not provide a “link up” or “link down”
	notification. Nodes may come and go from a CAN segment at any time,
	and on an individual basis. In general, one can't assert that a
	particular node is always present, always comes up first, or never
	comes up first.</P>
	<LI><P>CAN does not provide any indicator of which node sent a
	particular frame. Any node can send any frame, and the receiving
	nodes have no CAN-provided mechanism for identifying the source.</P>
	<LI><P>On a busy segment, CAN frames are sent in a strict priority
	order, with the priority determined by the content of the frame
	headers. If multiple nodes have frames to send at the same time, the
	highest priority (lowest numerical value header) frame will be sent
	first. There is no concept of “reserved bandwidth” except
	through frame priority, and low-priority frames may require
	significant time to be sent.</P>
	<LI><P>Nodes must be able to accept frames at the full CAN rate.
	Hardware filters must be usable to help with that, but even then
	nodes may receive adjacent frames addressed to them.</P>
</OL>
<P>Putting a unique source ID field in each frame ensures that the
frames are unique (item 1 above), and provides a frame-level
indicator of which node sent the frame for the purposes of
monitoring, debugging, etc (item 3). Using a distributed algorithm to
determine the value for that ID field prevents needing a single
“manager” to provide it, thereby handling item 2. The header bit
fields discussed below are organized to handle items 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>OpenLCB-CAN is required to work with standard CAN components, e.g.
bridges and computer adapters must not require customization to
operate with OpenLCB. This provides a stringent requirement on
protocol design, in that OpenLCB-CAN cannot require specific timing,
deliberate creation of error cases or specific error handling. 
</P>
<P>People will occasionally refer to a restriction against having
seven 1 bits in the top 11 bits of the CAN header. There is no such
restriction, and the statements are the result of a misunderstanding.
There is a restriction against having seven consecutive recessive
bits on the CAN connection, but sending seven consecutive 1 bits will
not result in this. CAN uses a bit-stuffing technique to prevent that
by inserting a dominant bit on the line after the fifth consecutive
recessive bit, and removing it at the receiver.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Annotations to the Specification</H2>
<P>This section provides background information on corresponding
sections of the Specification document. It's expected that two
documents will be read together.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<H3 CLASS="western">References and Context</H3>
<P>Note that we reference the Node ID specification, but only to the
extent that each node is required to have a unique Node ID. The
Specification would work equally well with a Node ID that was
allocated via any mechanism, and with any length from 2 to 8 bytes.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Frame Format</H3>
<P>OpenLCB uses a very vanilla transfer of frames, no special
features, to reduce complexity and increase robustness.</P>
<P>Standard header frames are also known as CAN 2.0A frames. Extended
header frames are also known as CAN 2.0B frames.</P>
<P>The specification is silent on the uses for standard (11-bit
header) frames. The proper-operation requirement is so nodes will
tolerate them in case they're needed for other purposes. The Atmel
bootloader () uses standard frames, for example, and the Microchip
bootloader () can use them. 
</P>
<P>This could also have been phrased as “shall ignore ...”, but
the current phrasing is thought to be more exact.</P>
<P>We don't use RTR because CAN semantics require a specific use for
it, which has been built into some silicon implementations. There are
also some arbitration issues, see: CiA Application Note 802 (2005)
and <A HREF="http://www.thecanmancan.com/?tag=rtr">http://www.thecanmancan.com/?tag=rtr</A>
for more information.</P>
<P>We don't use overload frames because not all CAN controller
hardware can deliberately send them. We require that nodes be able to
handle them because some CAN controller hardware will occasionally
send them automatically.</P>
<P>The CAN format has been allocated on nibble boundaries to make it
easier to e.g. read dumps of packets. The header is considered to be
right (LSB) aligned.</P>
<P>The reserved first bit (MSB) is likely to be used as a
priority-boost bit in the future, e.g. so that a gateway can gain
priority access to the CAN segment for various operations that
require synchronization or atomicity. CAN encodes “do first”
priority as 0 and “do later” as 1, so the specification requires
that a 1 bit be sent. To preserve the utility of this, nodes must not
require either a 1 nor 0 on receipt.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Throughput and Temporarily Deaf Nodes</H4>
<P>OpenLCB requires that CAN-attached nodes be able to handle the
full frame rate on the CAN bus. There is no guarantee that frames for
a given node will arrive with non-zero time between then. 
</P>
<P>Some nodes are not always able to process frames. For example, the
node may cease processing for a short time while writing non-volatile
memory. Higher-level protocols, e.g. configuration write datagrams,
have mechanisms built in to prevent overrun while writing
configuration memory, but there could be multiple activities going on
in parallel that will result in frames arriving while the node is not
processing.</P>
<P>Short outages can be covered by CAN hardware buffering, so long as
the node will eventually catch up even at full arrival rate. Outages
long enough that frames are lost due to e.g. buffer overflow require
node to broadcast that it's back up if hardware detected frame lost.
This is because tehre could have been frames of some form that
modified the OpenLCB node state, which are now lost (e.g. drop alias,
CIM/RIM in absence, or even higher level events)

</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Issues</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western">Addressing</H4>
<P>The Node ID size limits the number of unique nodes that can take
part in communications on the CAN segment. Because Node ID aliases
are assigned independently on each CAN segment, the only issue is how
many different nodes are involved, not which ones they are or what
pattern(s) are available in their address numbers.</P>
<P>For electrical/timing reasons, a segment itself can only support a
maximum of about 50 nodes, but communication also involves nodes off
the segment. For example, chaining N CAN segments via bridges will
generally make up to 50*N nodes available. We have a use case of
chaining small numbers of CAN segments together, implying the need to
address 500 or 1000 nodes. 
</P>
<P>As another example, a very large network might connect many CAN
segments via TCP/IP or other networked connections. Each CAN-attached
node might need to communicate with a larger number of others spread
across that network.</P>
<P>(CAN backbone case)</P>
<P>In some cases, want 2 aliases (source and destination), plus a few
more bits, in 29 bits total. 29-(2*12) = 5 is a pretty compelling
choice.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Collisions during Allocation</H4>
<P>(not talking CAN arbitration here, but two nodes trying to use
same alias) The allocation process resolves collisions (attempt to
use an already allocated Node ID alias), but that takes time.
Minimizing the number of collisions is good. If the address space is
just the size of the number of things you want to address, the
collisions get hard /slow to resolve across multiple nodes. This
points to having a factor of 2, at least, between the number of nodes
to be addressed and the size of the address space.</P>
<P>(Mostly talking about separate nodes here, not just one big
interface node: Points to CAN backbone case)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Size</H4>
<P>Reducing size most important (so far) in the stream protocol.</P>
<P>Events and Datagrams can be transmitted with a 16-bit alias size.</P>
<P>To get the full payload (8 bytes) for streaming requires getting
the rest of the protocol control, including two aliases for source
and destination, in the 29 bit header. Allowing 1 bit for
priority/extension, 1 for protocol control, 3 for MTI and stream
control (all very bare minima) leads to a 12-bit node ID alias
length. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Simplicity</H4>
<P>Byte vs nibble vs bit boundaries in code, when debugging the
protocol, etc.</P>
<P>Having extra bits available in the header allows much simpler MTI
coding, reserving specific bits for expansion instead of codes, etc.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Filtering</H4>
<P>Having the destination short enough to be in the header allows
automated filtering of traffic. Nodes must still deal with the full
rate, because messages can always be adjacent in time.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">From <META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen"><META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen">Node
ID Alias Allocation Algorithm doc</H2>
<P>OpenLCB nodes on CAN segments do CAN arbitration by using their
unique Node ID alias (NIDa) as part of the CAN header. This page
documents a proposed algorithm for assigning unique Node ID aliases. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<P>This method of assigning aliases and checking that they are unique
is necessary because of the characteristics and limitations oFromf
CAN. 
</P>
<P>Each node has 48-bit unique id, and each wants a 12-bit local
alias. Each assigns itself a potential 12-bit alias. The problem
comes in determining whether this alias is in use by another node. 
</P>
<P>If a node sends out an check message containing just the alias,
then it could expect that another node to complain if it has the same
alias. This would work, except in the (admittedly unlikely) case
where both nodes send out the identical check message simultaneously.
Neither would recognize a conflict and both would consider that they
own the same alias. Therefore, a method needs to be found that
guarantees that the check message(s) are unique, even if they are
sent simultaneously. 
</P>
<P><I>(timing of serialization of low-priority CAN nodes at network
startup)</I></P>
<P><I>(can store starting point, not just alias, for later use)</I></P>
<P>Unfortunately, limitations of CAN will not allow the full 48-bit
NodeID to be included in the check message. Doing so would violate
CAN rules as it could not be wholly contained in the header, and
packets with identical headers are not allowed to have differing
data-parts. 
</P>
<P>Therefore, the CIM/RIM method splits the NodeID into byte-sized
parts, sends out 4 check messages (CIM = Check Id Messages, RIM =
Reserved Id Message), each consisting of the alias and one quarter
(12 bits) of the 48 bit id. Only if all of the CIMs *do not* conflict
with another node (ie no RIM is received) does it guarantee that the
alias is not in use by another node. Even if two nodes send out the
identical packets simultaneously, at least one of these will differ
due to a differing ID-part between the two nodes.

<H3 CLASS="western">Algorithm</H3>
<P>Start with the six-byte unique Node ID in each node, with the

<P>Initialize a specific full-sequence 48bit PRNG with the 48 Node
ID. 
</P>
<P>A: 
</P>
<P>Take the next element from the PRNG . Derive the 12-bit value for
TCA, the tentative alias. If TCA is zero, repeat.</P>
<P>Start listening for CAN frames containing Check ID messages (CIMs)
and Reserved ID Messages (RIMs). A CIM consists of an extended header
with a 12 bit Source NIDa field, an 3 bit sequence field, a 12-bit
TestN field, and other bits to denote that this is a Check ID
Message. There is no other variable information in the frame. Having
NIDa, Nn and TestN in the message ensure that CAN arbitration will
work without error. An RIM is the same, except that it can be
identified as being a different message for diagnostic purposes; it
means the same thing upon receipt. 
</P>
<P>Send four CIMs with 0 through 3 in the Nn field, the 12-bit
quarters of the NodeID in the TestN field, and TCA in the Source NIDa
field. During this process, if a CIM or RIM is received that contains
the TCA value in its CI field, TCA does not belong to this node.
Repeat from (A). 
</P>
<P>Keep listening until your CAN hardware says your last CIM message
has been sent and the CAN link is idle, plus 500 msec. If you cannot
detect that condition, wait 1 second.</P>
<P>If no CIM or RIM with this TCA value in the CI field is received
before the end of the previous step, you've successfully allocated
TCA as this node's source NIDa. Send an RIM with TCA in the CI field
and go into normal operation. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If that message fails with an error occurring during the data
	portion of the message, it's possible that two nodes have the same
	NodeID, a fatal error. To prevent the OpenLCB being taken down, this
	node should stop trying to allocate an alias and signal the error to
	the user via some non-CAN method, e.g. LEDs, emitting smoke, etc.</P>
	<LI><P>If any other error occurs, repeat from A.</P>
</UL>
<P>While in normal operation, if you receive a CIM with your source
NIDa, send a RIM, which will cause the other node to back off and try
something else. 
</P>
<P>It should not be possible to receive an RIM with your allocated
source NIDa in normal operation. If you do, log an error (on whatever
it is they log it on there) and restart the process at (A). 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Proposed alias derivation</H4>
<P>The 12 bit alias has to be derived from a 48-bit sequence number
in a way that keeps as much entropy as possible.</P>
<P>Sequentially numbered nodes will have initial seeds that differ
only in the low bits of the PRNG output. For shift-register PRNGs,
this can present a problem, as all bytes of the result are shifting
together. Combining bytes (or even 12-bit chunks) via XOR or add
operations results in reduced entropy.</P>
<P>The OpenLCB proposed PRNG (next section) uses add operations with
a constant term to avoid this problem, so treating the 48-bit PRNG
output as four 12-but values, which are then XORed, works well.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Proposed PRNG</H4>
<P>The proposed 48-bit PRNG is from “A 48-Bit Pseudo-Random Number
Generator”, Heidi G. Kuehn, Communications of the ACM, Volume
4,&nbsp;Issue 8 (August 1961), pages 350-352.</P>
<P>x<SUB>i+1</SUB> = (2<SUP>9</SUP>+1) x<SUB>i</SUB> + c</P>
<P>where c = 29,741,096,258,473 or 0x1B0CA37A4BA9.The paper actually
describes a PRNG that uses signed arithmetic, but for our purposes
the 48<SUP>th</SUP> “sign” bit isn't important. <I>(verify that
about sign) (This is a byte+bit shift and add, so it's quick to
calculate)</I></P>
<P>Note that, unlike some other PNRGs, this one can generate a zero
result, and can accept a zero seed.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Discussion</H3>
<P>CAN arbitration reliably avoids collisions between frames with
unique headers. It does not guarantee arbitration between frames with
identical headers and no data; if the timing is right, they may
overlay each other such that only one frame appears to have been
sent. It is very difficult to ensure that two nodes send
initialization packets only at different times. In addition, CAN will
eventually signal an error if two packets with the same header and
different data payloads collide, but not all CAN interface hardware
provides reliable indications about why that error occurred. <I>(lock
step issue at startup)</I></P>
<P>At the highest level, this algorithm is broadcasting the complete
Node ID and tentative alias to see if any other node is checking the
same tentative alias. If two nodes have taken the same tentative
alias, at least one of the four packets used in that broadcast will
not be identical between the two nodes, because their six-byte Node
IDs are different in at least one bit. CAN will successfully
arbitrate this, and the other node will receive the frame, causing it
to back off.</P>
<P>CAN transmissions are not atomic operations; you can receive a
frame between the time you tell the hardware to send a frame and the
time that frame is actually sent. It's therefore possible for both
nodes contending for the same alias value to back off and try again.
Using the pseudo-random number generator as a sequence number makes
it likely that the next attempt will be made using different alias
values in the two nodes. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The use of
the sequence generator also makes the arbitration process faster in
the case of sequential Node ID values. People like to use small and
sequential numbers for things, and the sequence generator maps those
to very different values that are less likely to collide during
arbitration. </SPAN>
</P>
<P>The delays at the end of the algorithm are to ensure that higher
latency nodes, such as software nodes working through USB convertors,
can reply to CID messages from nodes that come up on a working link.
OpenLCB is a soft-real-time system, and software that's interacting
with it needs to have response times of a couple hundred milliseconds
or better to be reliable. The algorithm provides a wait of a few
times that to enable those programs to take part.</P>

<P>29-bit extended header and 8-byte payload results in a total
transmission taking about 135 bit times.</P>
<P>125Kbps with max-length extended header frames is about 900
frames/second. CAN is very good at running at 100% utilization, so
long as nodes can keep up and a proper set of priorities is in place.</P>
<P>CAN is designed to run at 100% usage without problem, and it's
routine for CAN segments in other contexts to run at 100% for
extended times. Therefore, the CAN network does not require any
inter-frame spacing, limitations on bandwidth usage, etc; the segment
can be allowed to run at 100%.</P>
<P>The real limitation is whether the nodes themselves can handle the
full rate of frame arrival. There is (currently) no mechanism in
OpenLCB to throttle the rate of frames arriving at a node, nor is it
easy to create one in a CAN network. The stream and datagram protocol
have been designed to allow a node to efficiently use a very limited
amount of buffer memory, but don't provide mechanisms to limit the
arrival of frames.</P>
<P>For long term reliability, a node <U>must</U> be able to
completely process an entire CAN frame in the time it takes to
receive the next one, which may be as little as 42 (?) bit times.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">CIM/RIM message content and format</H3>
<P>The CIM/RIM algorithm for finding aliases is designed to work
without any CAN errors. Arbitration conflicts are OK, but deliberate
errors are not, because different CAN implementations may deal with
them differently. During execution of the algorithm, some frames
might have the same header. They therefore have to have the same
contents, or else a non-arbitration error can occur.</P>
<P>Although it might be a useful debugging tool, putting the full NID
in the data portion of the frames can cause errors. Therefore, we
decided not to do that.</P>

<H1>OpenLCB Specification Conventions</H1>
<P>OpenLCB is not a formal standards-making body, but we are
interested in making it clear what's required and not required for
interoperation between OpenLCB nodes. Therefore, we are creating a
series of &quot;specifications&quot; and corresponding &quot;explanations&quot;
as specific documents. “Specifications” are normative, to the
extent that anything this bunch of happy campers does can be
proscriptive. “Explanations” are just that, coupled statements of
explanations and additional information that go with each
Specification.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Points:</H3>
<P>Write stuff in bog-standard Open Office HTML by convention.  We
had to use Open Office .odf format for the NMRA to get their funky
page layout, publishing the resulting PDF on the web; we can go that
way if we have to (the change tracking was nice visually, but harder
to use than SVN diffs), but we'd rather not. We have considered
DocBook format in the past, may still go that way, but don't want to
invest in the infrastructure now.</P>
<P>“Shall” should get used in specifications.  “Must” should
be avoided there.  “Must” is OK in a explanation, which are more
information and non-normative:  “Designers must remember that wires
get hot...”</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The various parts of specifications
should be identified as normative or informative, because there are
always non-normative parts of standards.  Try to keep the informative
parts in the explanation document, but when they need to be present
so the specification can be read by itself, be sure to label them
clearly.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">“Devices may, but are not required
to, ...”</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Make the status of “reserved”
things clear:  “Must be set to 1 on creation and not checked
thereafter” and  “Must be set to 1 on creation, and must be
received as 1 to be considered valid” are different.  One works for
a bit that's reserved for some orthogonal future expansion; the other
is needed to define an exclusive (hence non-orthogonal) future
option.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The primary documents in this directory
are in XML DocBook format under SVN control. Each time these are
updated, the HTML and PDF versions linked above are automatically
created from the primary documents. The HTML and PDF files are not
kept in SVN.</P>

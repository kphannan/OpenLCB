<H1>OpenLCB Specification Conventions</H1>
<P>OpenLCB is not a formal standards-making body, but we are
interested in making it clear what's required and not required for
interoperation between OpenLCB nodes. Therefore, we are creating a
series of &quot;specifications&quot; and corresponding &quot;explanations&quot;
as specific documents. “Specifications” are normative, to the
extent that anything this bunch of happy campers does can be
proscriptive. “Explanations” are just that, coupled statements of
explanations and additional information that go with each
Specification.</P>
<P>Three types of documents:</P>
<DL>
	<DT><I>Specifications </I>
	</DT><DD>
	Specifications are agreed to be normative, to the extent that
	anything this bunch of happy campers does can be proscriptive. A
	statements should be included in a specification when it's “clearly
	necessary” and “clearly correct”. 
	</DD><DT>
	<I>Explanations </I>
	</DT><DD>
	These are agreed-to documents that explain a specification and
	provide stable information useful to implementors. Statements should
	be included in a specification when they are “likely to be useful”
	and “not clearly wrong”; this is a lower standard than the one
	for specifications. Opinions and less-desirable options are OK when
	clearly labelled as such. 
	</DD><DT>
	<I>Development documents </I>
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	These are things that are in significant flux, but still useful to
	developers and implementers. 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
The first two can also appear in “draft” or “adopted” form.</P>
<P>Generally, an implementer should start with the relevant adopted
specifications and be sure to understand what's really required for
the implementation to work well. Then, the implementor should move on
to the adopted explanations to make sure the background is
understood, learn about issues to be considered and decisions to be
made, and get information about possible approaches. Finally, the
implementer may want to spend time on the draft and development
documents to get an idea of what the future might bring.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Points:</H3>
<P>Write stuff in bog-standard Open Office HTML by convention. The
<A HREF="Template.html">Template.html</A> file is a starting point. 
</P>
<P>We had to use Open Office .odf format for the NMRA to get their
funky page layout, publishing the resulting PDF on the web; we can go
that way if we have to (the change tracking was nice visually, but
harder to use than SVN diffs), but we'd rather not. We have
considered DocBook format in the past, may still go that way, but
don't want to invest in the infrastructure now.</P>
<P>To make direct access easier, the file naming convention is
(wire)(topic)(type).html, in Pascal case (leading-capital camel
case). For example, “CanMessageTransportSpec.html” vs
“CanMessageTransportExp.html” vs “TcpMessageTransportSpec.html”.</P>
<P>“Shall” should get used in specifications. “Must” should
be avoided there. “Must” is OK in a explanation, which are more
information and non-normative: “Designers must remember that wires
get hot...” Specifications can describe options using “Devices
may, but are not required to, ...”, but they call also just be
silent about options.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The various parts of specifications
should be identified as normative or informative, because there are
always non-normative parts of standards. Try to keep the informative
parts in the explanation document, but when they need to be present
so the specification can be read by itself, be sure to label them
clearly.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Make the status of “reserved”
things clear: “Must be set to 1 on creation and not checked
thereafter” and “Must be set to 1 on creation, and must be
received as 1 to be considered valid” are different. One works for
a bit that's reserved for some orthogonal future expansion; the other
is needed to define an exclusive (hence non-orthogonal) future
option.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The primary documents in this directory
are in XML DocBook format under SVN control. Each time these are
updated, the HTML and PDF versions linked above are automatically
created from the primary documents. The HTML and PDF files are not

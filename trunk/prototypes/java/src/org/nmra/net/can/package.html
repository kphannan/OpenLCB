CAN-specific NMRAnet functionality.

<p>
This package does not provide a CAN implementation; that's 
to be done in a device-specific way elsewhere.

<p>
For testing purposes, that implementation is currently
taken from the {@link tools.cansim} package.

<p>
Although Java guarantees that an int is 32 bits and a long
is 64 bits, we want this code to be easy to translate to other
languages (e.g. C) and smaller processors.  We therefore use int for 
quantities that must be at least 16 bits, and long for 
quantities that must be at least 32 bits. Since Java does
not have an "unsigned" modifier, we add that as a comment
on appropriate declarations.

<H1>Proposal for S, RP, TN Documents</H1>
<H2>Standards</H2>
<P>Standards are required of all implementations. They therefore are
the baseline, mandatory functionality. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Standard is a public document that
specifies the minimum requirements for interchange of equipment. To
be granted a conformance seal, a manufacturer must meet all relevant
requirements specified in all standards. &quot;

	<DT>S 9.6 - Base NMRAnet functionality 
	</DT><DD>
	Includes startup procedures, etc. The base includes sending and
	receiving Events and Streams.</DD><DT>
	S 9.6.1 - Base NMRAnet functionality on CAN segments 
	</DT><DD>
	All the messages and interactions of the base functionality, in CAN
	form; requires S 9.6

	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	All the messages and interactions of the base functionality, in
	TCP/IP form; requires S 9.6 
	</DD></DL>
<H2>
Recommended Practices</H2>
<P>Recommended Practices describe optional features and capabilities.
Those need not be present, but if they are present they must function
as described in the RP. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Recommended Practice is a public document
that specifies the maximum requirements for interchange of equipment.
For any DCC product to be granted a conformance seal, the product
must not violate any recommended practice. &quot;

Technical Notes</H2>
<P>Technical Notes are non-normative documents which convey
information useful to the model railroading community. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Technical Note is Technical Department
document used to convey information useful to the model railroading
community. Technical Notes are only available to NMRA members.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>DPH: This last sentence seems ominous – we will want
these to be available to <U>all</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
NMRAnet users.<BR>BobJ: I agree. Maybe the NMRA has some other type
of doc we can use. Or we can write a “For Dummies” book outside
the auspices of the NMRA... </SPAN></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There doesn't seem to be a single system of numbering for
Technical Notes. Some are based on dates (TN-2004-1), some are linked
to standards (TN-9.2.1), and some have multipart numbers TN-3-05. The
following numbers are just notional.</P>
<DL>
	<DT>TN 9.6.1 - Overview and Glossary 
	</DT><DD>
	An introduction to the overall picture, justification, etc. 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.2 - Assigning Unique Node and Event IDs 
	</DT><DD>
	A discussion of how the various IDs are uniquely assigned. <I>(Is
	this actually normative, and needs to be in the Standard or RP? Or
	does the S/RP just need to say &quot;You must use an ID assigned to
	you by NMRA published procedures.&quot;)</I> 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.3 - NMRAnet Networking 
	</DT><DD>
	Techniques for bridging, filtering and translating NMRAnet messages 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.4 - NMRAnet for modular and ad-hoc layouts 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Techniques for using NMRAnet on modular layouts that need to be
	rapidly reconfigured; for using NMRAnet when aggregating modular
	layouts into large exhibition layouts.

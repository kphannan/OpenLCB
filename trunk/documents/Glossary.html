<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Times"><b>Glossary</b></h1>
<p class="p2">A list of terms used in OpenLCB.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>Common Terms</b></h2>
<p class="p4">Alias</p>
<p class="p4">Short form of a Node ID number which can be mapped back and forth to the full number. Often used as "NID Alias", "DID Alias" or "SID Alias"", which are then written NIDa, DIDa and SIDa.</p>
<p class="p4">Board</p>
<p class="p4">Not really something that occurs in OpenLCB itself, we need to talk about how the common term "board" maps onto OpenLCB. E.g. A node (board) may connect to several things (devices) on the layout.</p>
<p class="p4">Bridge</p>
<p class="p4">Connects two OpenLCB segments with minimal changes to the content of the messages. For example, a bridge between two CAN segments would allow more nodes to be attach to the combined segments as if they were one; a bridge between a CAN segment and Ethernet segment would transform message format, but transfer every message.</p>
<p class="p4">Datagram</p>
<p class="p4">The datagram protocol is a way for a OpenLCB node to efficiently send a short, definite-length message to another specific node. In that, it lies in between “event messages”, which efficiently sends very short event IDs to all interested nodes, and the streaming protocol, which sends long messages between specific nodes, at some cost in efficiency.</p>
<p class="p4">Device</p>
<p class="p4">Not really something that occurs in OpenLCB itself, we need to talk about how the common term "device" maps onto OpenLCB. E.g. A node (board) may connect to several things (devices) on the layout..</p>
<p class="p4">DID</p>
<p class="p4">Destination Node ID - Node ID of the node to which a specific message is addressed.</p>
<p class="p4">Event</p>
<p class="p4">OpenLCB allows nodes to notify each other when specific "events" occur on the layout. These in turn can cause nodes to take particular actions. Events are not necessarily attached to a producer ('Button 2 pressed') or attached to a consumer ('Turn off light 4'), but rather to an overall state change ('Set for nighttime operation'). This is called a "Producer/Consumer model".</p>
<p class="p4">Event ID (EID)</p>
<p class="p4">The number that identifies a specific event. OpenLCB event IDs must be globally unique.</p>
<p class="p4">Events are not associated with any particular node. It may be convenient to use e.g. Node ID as a way of numbering them uniquely, but Node IDs and Event IDs are not related.</p>
<p class="p4">Gateway</p>
<p class="p4">Connects two segments of the OpenLCB while translating to a different wire protocol. For example, a gateway can change NodeIDs on one side of the Router into aliases on the other side. The use of unique identifiers in OpenLCB is meant to reduce the need for gateways. They generally only appear to connect the wider network to a CAN link.</p>
<p class="p4">Installation</p>
<p class="p4">An OpenLCB installation is the complete set of OpenLCB hardware, nodes, etc, that can be reached from any one of them.</p>
<p class="p4">Node</p>
<p class="p4">Unit of addressibility for the network. Every OpenLCB interaction originates in a node. Every board that connects to OpenLCB is at least one node. For example, a simple turnout controller board is one node, while a PC with multiple programs running may contain several nodes.</p>
<p class="p4">Node ID (NID)</p>
<p class="p4">Number identifying a specific node. OpenLCB node IDs must be globally unique, so they form a one-to-one mapping to the nodes themselves.</p>
<p class="p4">Message</p>
<p class="p4">The basic unit of OpenLCB communication.</p>
<p class="p4">MTI</p>
<p class="p4">Message Type Indicator - identifies a common message type. (This term is still under discussion)</p>
<p class="p4">Producer/Consumer Model</p>
<p class="p4">A way of thinking about communications on a layout network. Events (unique messages on the layout network) are “produced” by some node(s), and “consumed” by other node(s). An event indicates something happened, but the corresponding messages isn't necessarily a status report or a command for something to change; it's just an announcement of the event. That event can be produced by many different sources (e.g. the “use passing siding” event could be produced by a push button at either end of the siding, or on a dispatcher panel), and can be consumed by several sources (it can turn on lamps on a panel, set turnouts in multiple places, etc).</p>
<p class="p4">Repeater</p>
<p class="p4">Connects two segments of the same type at the physical level, without transformation of message format.</p>
<p class="p4">Router</p>
<p class="p4">OpenLCB routers forward traffic from one link to another without reformatting. This can be a simple as receiving on one link and forwarding on N, or it could involve tracking e.g. event usage and only forwarding needed messages.</p>
<p class="p4">SID</p>
<p class="p4">Source Node ID - Node ID of the node which originated a specific message.</p>
<p class="p4">Segment</p>
<p class="p4">Subset of an overall OpenLCB installation which is reached via one or more translaters and/or gateways. A segment typically uses a specific wire protocol.</p>
<p class="p4">Stream</p>
<p class="p4">Streams are a method of moving a large number of bytes between two nodes. The streaming protocol defines a way to do this in OpenLCB.</p>
<p class="p4">Wire protocol</p>
<p class="p4">Version of the OpenLCB common messages, interactions, etc adapted to a particular transport mechanism. Examples are the wire protocols for CAN bus segments and TCP/IP links.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>Wire Protocol Terms</b></h2>
<p class="p4">Packet</p>
<p class="p4">A Packet is a single transmission on a OpenLCB segment.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Times"><b>CAN Wire Protocol Terms</b></h2>
<p class="p4">Frame</p>
<p class="p4">A Frame is packet as it is defined on the CAN bus. It consists of a 11 or 29 bit CAN header and zero through 8 bytes of data.</p>

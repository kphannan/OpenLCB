"make" of a directory does clean/compile/lib/link. 
The Makefiles currently leave the results in the same directory.

To build and run a test executable:
 make all && CanMrrlcbTest
 
See Makefile and standard.mk for more build information.

The code in src/openlcb is common with the Ardunio 
prototype (svn linked).  For more information on that
structure, see:

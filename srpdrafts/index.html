<H2 STYLE="page-break-before: always">NMRA definitions</H2>
<H3>Standards</H3>
<P>Standards are required of all implementations. They therefore are
the baseline, mandatory functionality. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Standard is a public document that
specifies the minimum requirements for interchange of equipment. To
be granted a conformance seal, a manufacturer must meet all relevant
requirements specified in all standards. &quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Recommended Practices</H3>
<P>Recommended Practices describe optional features and capabilities.
Those need not be present, but if they are present they must function
as described in the RP. 
</P>
<P>From the NMRA DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Recommended Practice is a public document
that specifies the maximum requirements for interchange of equipment.
For any DCC product to be granted a conformance seal, the product
must not violate any recommended practice. &quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although the terms of both Standards and Recommended Practices use
the “must” construction, note the difference between “must
meet” and “must not violate”. In practice, it's not at all
clear what “the maximum requirements for interchange” means.
Perhaps that was intended to be “the requirements for maximum
interchange”?</P>
<H3>Technical Notes</H3>
<P>Technical Notes are non-normative documents which convey
information useful to the model railroading community. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Technical Note is Technical Department
document used to convey information useful to the model railroading
community. Technical Notes are only available to NMRA members.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>DPH: This last sentence seems ominous – we will want
these to be available to <U>all</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
NMRAnet users.<BR>BobJ: I agree. Maybe the NMRA has some other type
of doc we can use. Or we can write a “For Dummies” book outside
the auspices of the NMRA... </SPAN></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There doesn't seem to be a single system of numbering for
Technical Notes. Some are based on dates (TN-2004-1), some are linked
to standards (TN-9.2.1), and some have multipart numbers TN-3-05. 
</P>
<H2><META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen"><!-- $Id$ -->Proposal
A for S, RP, TN Documents for OpenLCB</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The proposal is to use the 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
digit of the NMRA number system to indicate subtopics for e.g. wire
formats and advanced capabilities. S9.6 refers to the base
technology, written to be wire-format agnostic. S9.6.n would be
standards for a specific kind of implementation, with RP9.6.n being
corresponding Recommended Practices. The numbering convention for
Technical Notes is not clear, but the intent is to provide Technical
Note numbers that make it clear with part of S9.6 they refer to. This
may require e.g. an additional digit so there can be multiple S&amp;RP
9.6.2 Technical Notes.</P>
<H3>Standards</H3>
<P>One approach would be to group standards by implementation form:</P>
<DL>
	<DT>S 9.6 - Base NMRAnet functionality 
	</DT><DD>
	Includes startup procedures, etc. The base includes proper formats
	for sending and receiving Events, Datagrams and Streams. Note that a
	device is not required to send or receive those, just that if it
	does so, it does it in a standard way.</DD><DT>
	S 9.6.1 - Base NMRAnet functionality on CAN segments 
	</DT><DD>
	All the messages and interactions of the base functionality, in CAN
	form; requires S 9.6 
	</DD><DT>
	S 9.6.2 - Base NMRAnet functionality on TCP/IP links 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	All the messages and interactions of the base functionality, in
	TCP/IP form; requires S 9.6 
	</DD></DL>
<P>
This would result in S 9.6, S 9.6.1, etc being comprehensive
documents, hence large. There would be large parts of the documents
that wouldn't apply to e.g. simple nodes. Another approach, not
usually used by the NMRA, would be to break the standard into the
independent protocols:</P>
<P>S 9.6 – Base NMRAnet functionality</P>
<P>S 9.6.1 – Event transfer</P>
<P>S 9.6.2 - Datagram transfer</P>
<P>S 9.6.2 – Stream transfer</P>
<P>S 9.6.3 – Configuration protocol</P>
<P>S 9.6.4 – Display protocol</P>
<P>etc. As needed, there could be CAN-specific versions at the next
subpoint, e.g. S 9.6.2.1; this would not be needed for many of the
high-level protocols. Fine granularity like this would be a real
advantage as additional protocols and implementations are developed,
because earlier standards would not have to be revisited.</P>
<H3>Recommended Practices</H3>
<P>The key question is how to define “optional” for OpenLCB. Many
parts are optional in various contexts. At the same time, NMRA RP's
aren't really “optional”, because if the function is present, it
has to work as the RP is defined. In some sense, that makes almost
all of OpenLCB a “Recommended Practice”...</P>
<DL>
	<DT>RP 9.6.1 – Some Optional Function in NMRAnet 
	</DT><DD>
	Includes the messages and interactions for …</DD><DT>
	RP 9.6.1.1 - Some Optional Function on CAN segments 
	</DT><DD>
	... as specifically handled on CAN segments 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-left: 0cm">
	RP 9.6.1.2 - Another Optional Function on CAN segments 
	</DD><DD>
	... as specifically handled on CAN segments 
	</DD><DT>
	RP 9.6.2.1 - Some Optional Function on TCP/IP links 
	</DT><DD>
	... as specifically handled on TCP/IP segments 
	</DD><DT>
	RP 9.6.3 - Remote Configuration of NMRAnet Nodes 
	</DT><DD>
	Using Events and Streams to configure NMRAnet nodes remotely, e.g.
	as defined by the Configuration Protocol.</DD><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	RP 9.6.4 - ?? 
	</DT></DL>
<P>
The DCC S&amp;RPs have demonstrated that the having a RP modify a
standard becomes very confusing to manufacturers. Better is to have a
clear demarkation.</P>
<H3>Technical Notes</H3>
<P>OpenLCB uses an open process, where a lot of contextual
information is developed along side the “standards”. Although not
formal standards, this information is just as important because it
helps implementors understand the logic and structure of the system
that the standards define. This information should be carried over
if/when OpenLCB becomes standardized by the NMRA. The following
numbers are just notional examples of the types of things that would
need to be published. The numbers are particularly notional, because
of uncertainty about the NMRA convention, see above.</P>
<DL>
	<DT>TN 9.6.1 - Overview and Glossary 
	</DT><DD>
	An introduction to the overall picture, justification, etc. An early
	draft of this is provided as <A HREF="../documents/TN-9-6-NMRANET-Overview-Draft.pdf">TN-9-6-NMRANET-Overview</A>
	until numbers are settled.</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.2 - Assigning Unique Node and Event IDs 
	</DT><DD>
	A discussion of how the various IDs are uniquely assigned. <I>(Is
	this actually normative, and needs to be in the Standard or RP? Or
	does the S/RP just need to say &quot;You must use an ID assigned to
	you by NMRA published procedures.&quot;)</I> 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.3 - NMRAnet Networking 
	</DT><DD>
	Techniques for bridging, filtering and translating NMRAnet messages 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.4 - NMRAnet for modular and ad-hoc layouts 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Techniques for using NMRAnet on modular layouts that need to be
	rapidly reconfigured; for using NMRAnet when aggregating modular
	layouts into large exhibition layouts.

<H2>Proposal B for S, RP, TN Documents for OpenLCB</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An alternate approach is to plan on
incremental documents:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S9.6.1: Physical Layer for each of the
wire protocols</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S9.6.2: Link Layer for each of the wire
protocols</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S9.6.3: Event Exchange</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S9.6.4: Datagram Exchange</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">S9.6.5: Configuration Protocol</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(etc)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most of the content would be common,
with just small appendices for CAN-specific, TCP/IP specific, etc
details.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The problem with this is that e.g. MTIs
would be changed as further protocols are defined.  They should
perhaps be in a separate appendix, similar to the way that DCC
manufacturer codes are maintained now (and they should be a globally
visible and updated XML file, not in a PDF that only people can read
with no history information)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tech notes would then be explanatory. 
Given the recent interest by the NMRA management to “turn RPs into
Standards”, there seems little reason to propose RPs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><!-- The following used to be in the document, and perhaps can
     go back, but it's not true now. Commented out until that
     is sorted.
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The primary documents in this directory
are in XML DocBook format under SVN control. Each time these are
updated, the HTML and PDF versions linked above are automatically
created from the primary documents. The HTML and PDF files are not
kept in SVN.</P>

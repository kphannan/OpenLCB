<H2 STYLE="page-break-before: always"><META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Bob Jacobsen"><!-- $Id$ -->Proposal
for S, RP, TN Documents for OpenLCB</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The proposal is to use the 3<SUP>rd</SUP>
digit of the NMRA number system to indicate subtopics for e.g. wire
formats and advanced capabilities. S9.6 refers to the base
technology, written to be wire-format agnostic. S9.6.n would be
standards for a specific kind of implementation, with RP9.6.n being
corresponding Recommended Practices. The numbering convention for
Technical Notes is not clear, but the intent is to provide Technical
Note numbers that make it clear with part of S9.6 they refer to. This
may require e.g. an additional digit so there can be multiple S&amp;RP
9.6.2 Technical Notes.</P>
<H3>Standards</H3>
<P>Standards are required of all implementations. They therefore are
the baseline, mandatory functionality. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Standard is a public document that
specifies the minimum requirements for interchange of equipment. To
be granted a conformance seal, a manufacturer must meet all relevant
requirements specified in all standards. &quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
	<DT>S 9.6 - Base NMRAnet functionality 
	</DT><DD>
	Includes startup procedures, etc. The base includes proper formats
	for sending and receiving Events, Datagrams and Streams. Note that a
	device is not required to send or receive those, just that if it
	does so, it does it in a standard way.</DD><DT>

Recommended Practices</H3>
<P>Recommended Practices describe optional features and capabilities.
Those need not be present, but if they are present they must function
as described in the RP. 
</P>
<P>From the NMRA DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Recommended Practice is a public document
that specifies the maximum requirements for interchange of equipment.
For any DCC product to be granted a conformance seal, the product
must not violate any recommended practice. &quot;

Technical Notes</H3>
<P>Technical Notes are non-normative documents which convey
information useful to the model railroading community. 
</P>
<P>From the DCC Working Group: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An NMRA Technical Note is Technical Department
document used to convey information useful to the model railroading
community. Technical Notes are only available to NMRA members.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>DPH: This last sentence seems ominous – we will want
these to be available to <U>all</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
NMRAnet users.<BR>BobJ: I agree. Maybe the NMRA has some other type
of doc we can use. Or we can write a “For Dummies” book outside
the auspices of the NMRA... </SPAN></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There doesn't seem to be a single system of numbering for
Technical Notes. Some are based on dates (TN-2004-1), some are linked
to standards (TN-9.2.1), and some have multipart numbers TN-3-05. The
following numbers are just notional.</P>
<DL>
	<DT>TN 9.6.1 - Overview and Glossary 
	</DT><DD>
	An introduction to the overall picture, justification, etc. An early
	draft of this is provided as <A HREF="../documents/TN-9-6-NMRANET-Overview-Draft.pdf">TN-9-6-NMRANET-Overview</A>
	until numbers are settled.</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.2 - Assigning Unique Node and Event IDs 
	</DT><DD>
	A discussion of how the various IDs are uniquely assigned. <I>(Is
	this actually normative, and needs to be in the Standard or RP? Or
	does the S/RP just need to say &quot;You must use an ID assigned to
	you by NMRA published procedures.&quot;)</I> 
	</DD><DT>
	TN 9.6.3 - NMRAnet Networking 
	</DT><DD>
	Techniques for bridging, filtering and translating NMRAnet messages

<P><FONT SIZE=4><U>OpenLCB CAN Physical Spec and its Relation to NMRA
S9.5.1</U></FONT></P>
<P><U>Background</U></P>
<P>The NMRA is trying to develop a model railroad local control bus
to carry MRR-accessory information. Several pre-existing projects
have been in process that were put forward as candidates for the
eventual NMRAnet(R). These include: S9.5, led by Don Voss, OpenLCB
(designated S9.6 by the NMRA), MERG CBUS led by Mike Bolton and Gil
Fuchs, and AtBus, led by Roger Edwards. 
</P>
<P><U>Development of a Proposed Standard and its associated Technical
Note</U></P>
<P>Members of this community (BJ, AS, JD, and DH) joined an ad hoc
NMRA committee to develop a common CAN physical specification. This
committee was formed at the Milwaukee Convention, and included
membership from the the above mentioned projects, and two
manufacturers, Silicon Railway and RRCirKits. The committee was under
the auspices of Di Voss, and Karl Kobel was tasked as chair. The
aforementioned OpenLCB members wrote the CAN Physical Spec, S9.x.1
(here) and associated Technical Note,TN9.x.1 (here) for consideration
of the NMRA Board as a NMRA Standard. 
</P>
<P>Don Voss, as S9.5 representative, was part of the committee, and
put forward extensions to the International CAN Spec ISO 11898-1; to
require an increase (20k) to the minimum Rdiff parameter of the
drivers; and to require a split-termination of the bus. These items
were duly discussed and the committee felt that modifying an
international standard would lead to suspect advantages and definite
disadvantages. The advantages claimed were increased number of nodes
and bus length, which were based on limited theoretical information
in two manufacturers datasheets. The disadvantages included: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It will exclude commercially available equipment that is ISO
	11898-1 compliant;</P>
	<LI><P>It will likely lead to NMRAnet compliant systems that will
	fail. This will be very difficult for the end user to both detect
	and correct without sophisticated equipment. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>These suggestions were eventually not required and likely to make
the resulting standard unstable and was rejected. Don Voss at this
point left the group. 
</P>
<P>The committee duly submitted the S9.x.1 and TN9.x.1 documents via
Karl Kobel to the NMRA Standards Manager Didrik Voss, who is the
brother of Don Voss. 
</P>
<P><U>Actions of the NMRA Board and Its Agents</U></P>
<P>Subsequent to their submission, without communication to or
consultation with the committee, Didrik Voss modified the documents,
including the rejected Don Voss suggestions, and deleting the power
distribution across the bus.  He then publiched both sets of
documents onto the NMRA website, again without notification of the
committee or authors.  Despite extensive criticisms the Don Voss
changes were retained, although he did retract the power-distribution
before his final submission to the board. 
</P>
<P>In a <U>closed</U> meeting in February, the NMRA Board accepted
the changed document. As of the date of the writing, the committee
has not been informed of the decision, nor the reasoning behind it. 
We are aware that the modified S9.x.1 has been published as S9.5.1 on
the NMRA webite, with the authors names deleted.  We note that this
numbering suggests that the is is part of the S9.5 proposals, ie part
of Don Voss's  proposed S9.5. 
</P>
<P>We have serious difficulties with the above process: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The original S/TN9.x.1 documents are copyrighted material.
	The NMRA has published derivative works without seeking nor
	obtaining permission. We reserve our right to seek legal remedies. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Numbering the posted standard as S9.5.1 makes a farce of the
	NMRAnet process.  The ongoing process has lead to the loss of talent
	from the NMRA's available pool of expertise, and casts ridicule on
	the NMRA. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>It displays the blatant bias that Didrik Voss, and the Board
	as proxy, towards his brother Don, contrary to the Bylaws of the
	NMRA. A formal review of these Bylaw violations will be sought from
	the NMRA President and Board. 
	</P>

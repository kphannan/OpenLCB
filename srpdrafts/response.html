<P>OpenLCB CAN Physical Spec and its Relation to NMRA S9.5.1</P>
<P>Background: The NMRA is trying to develop a model railroad local
control bus to carry MRR-accessory information.  Several pre-existing
projects have been in process that were put forward as candidates for
the eventual NMRAnet(R).  These include: S9.5, led by Don Voss,
OpenLCB (designated S9.6 by the NMRA), MERG CBUS led by Mike Bolton
and Gil Fuchs, and AtBus, led by Roger Edwards.  
</P>
<P>Members of this community (BJ, AS, JD, and DH) joined an ad hoc
NMRA committee to develop a common CAN physical specification.  This
committee was formed at the Milwaukee Convention, and included
membership from the the above mentioned projects, and two
manufacturers, Silicon Railway and RRCirKits.  The committee was
under the auspices of Di Voss, and Karl Kobel was tasked as chair. 
The aforementioned OpenLCB members wrote the CAN Physical Spec (here)
and associated Technical Note (here) for consideration of the NMRA
Board as a NMRA Standard.  
</P>
<P>Don Voss, as S9.5 representative, was part of the committee, and
put forward extensions to the International CAN Spec ISO 11898-1; to
require an increase (20k) to the minimum Rdiff parameter of the
drivers; and to require a split-termination of the bus.  These items
were duly discussed and the committee felt that modifying an
international standard would lead to suspect advantages and definite
disadvantages.  The advantages claimed were increased number of nodes
and bus length, which were based on limited theoretical information
in two manufacturers datasheets.  The disadvantages included: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It will exclude commercially available equipment that is ISO
	11898-1 compliant;</P>
	<LI><P>It will likely lead to NMRAnet compliant systems that will
	fail.  This will be very difficult for the end user to both detect
	and correct without sophisticated equipment.  
	</P>
</UL>
<P>These suggestions were eventually not required and likely to make
the resulting standard unstable and was rejected.  Don Voss at this
point left the group.  
</P>
<P>The committee duly submitted the S9.x.1 and TN9.x.1 documents via
Karl Kobel to the NMRA Standards Manager Didrik Voss, who is the
brother of Don Voss.  Didrik Voss modified the documents, without
communication or consultation with the committee, as per Don Voss's
suggestions.  He also deleted power distribution across the bus
aspect, although he retracted this before his final submission.    
</P>
<P>In a *closed* meeting in February, the NMRA Board accepted the
changed document.  None of this was communicated to teh committee
members before the document was posted as S9.5.1, which is the
designation for the Don Voss proposal.  
</P>
<P>We have serious difficulties with the above process: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The original S/TN9.x.1 documents are copyrighted material. 
	The NMRA has published derivative works without seeking nor
	obtaining permission.  We reserve our right to seek legal remedies. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Numbering the posted standard as S9.5.1 makes a farce of the
	NMRAnet process.  It has lead to the loss of talent from the NMRA's
	available pool of expertise, and casts ridicule on the NMRA.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>It displays the blatant bias that Didrik Voss, and the Board
	as proxy, towards his brother Don, contrary to the Bylaws of the
	NMRA. A formal review of these Bylaw violations will be sought from
	the NMRA President and Board. 
	</P>

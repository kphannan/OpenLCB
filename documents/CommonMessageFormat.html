<H1>OpenLCB Common Message Format</H1>
<P>A common message consists of several parts: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Node ID Number of the Source node
	(SID) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Message Type Indicator (MTI) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In some cases, the Destination
	Node ID (DID) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In some cases, a P/C Event ID
	(EID) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Message content, as defined by the particular message type 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Each OpenLCB wire protocol will define local representations for
each of these components. This may involve replacement (e.g. using a
shorter &quot;Alias&quot; token for the node ID number), reordering,
and/or specific representations that differ from the common ones, but
in all cases it must be possible to translate from the wire protocol
message to a complete common message using only locally available
information. 
</P>
<P>By convention, multi-byte quantities in OpenLCB are represented in
big-endian order. The most significant byte is sent first, and stored
at the lowest address. This is the same as Ethernet and the common
internet protocols, but not the same as the Intel x86 architecture. 
</P>
<P>Reserved quantities must be created with a zero value unless
otherwise specified. When processing a message, any reserved
quantities must be ignored unless otherwise specified. When
transporting a message, reserved quantities must be transported
unchanged. The zero value sometimes indicates a non-initialized
value. 
</P>
<H2>Node ID Numbers - NID</H2>
<P>A node ID number is 48 bits. The NMRA will allocate number ranges
to individuals or organizations upon request, and maintain a public
list of assignments. A detailed mechanism for kinds of delegation has
been <A HREF="NidUniqueAssignment.html">separately proposed</A>. 
</P>
<H2>Message Type Indicator (MTI)</H2>
<P>The common Message Type Indicator (MTI) is a 16 bit quantity. 
</P>
<P>Each specific MTI has a specific defined content <A HREF="CommonMessageDefinitions.html">documented
elsewhere</A>, but there are a few general points. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Messages are variable length. The
	specific wire protocol is responsible for carrying length
	information as needed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the message carries a
	destination address, that destination node ID (destination address)
	is the first part of the message content. The form of a Destination
	Node ID is defined by the particular wire protocol, but must be
	mappable to the full Node ID of the intended destination. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P>The common Message Type Indicator (MTI) is a 16 bit quantity. Note
that specific wire protocols may remap this.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The most-significant 5 bits are
	reserved as 00110; nodes must send and check that value.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The next 7 bits are used to
	indicate the message type. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The top two of these are used to
	form static priority groups. A 0 bit is considered to have more
	priority (can be processed first), a 1 bit less priority (can be
	processed later). The MSB makes a larger statement about priority
	than the LSB of these two. Priority processing is permitted but not
	required. The priority group bits are part of the overall message
	type.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The next bit is reserved as 0;
	nodes must send and check that value.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The lower four bits indicate a
	specific type. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following bit is reserved as
	0; nodes much send and check that value.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
	from-least-significant bit indicates that this message carries a
	destination node address (DID) when set to 1. Setting 0 means that
	the message is globally addressed. If a Destination Node ID (DID) is
	present, it is located at the start of the message content. The form
	of a Destination Node ID is defined by the particular wire protocol,
	but must be mappable to the full NID of the intended destination. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The next-to-least-significant bit indicates this message
	carries a P/C Event ID field when set to 1. Setting 0 means that the
	message does not carry a P/C event ID. If a P/C Event ID is present,
	it's at the start of the message, except after the Destination Node
	ID, if present. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The least-significant bit when set to 1 indicates this
	message carries a flag byte after the DID and/or EID determined by
	the above bits. The low bits of that byte can be relocated in CAN
	messages, see the definition of the CAN wire protocol.</P>
</UL>
<P>We've chosen to allocate bit fields to make decoding simpler; if
possible, aligned on nibble boundaries to make it easy to read as
hexadecimal numbers. Note that, as a special dispensation for CAN,
higher priority messages (MTIs with lower numerical values) may pass
lower priority ones; this must be taken into account when designing
protocols.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Specific values are allocated and
documented in a <A HREF="MtiAllocations.ods">separate worksheet</A>
(<A HREF="MtiAllocations.pdf">PDF version</A>). We keep them in just
that one place to avoid conflicting updates.</P>
<H3>CAN considerations</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The standard CAN MTI field is 12 bits
in the header (messages without destination address) or one byte in
the data segment (addressed messages).  Since CAN frames only carry 8
data bytes, a 1-byte MTI short form will be used at first. The
possibility of longer MTI values has been reserved.</P>

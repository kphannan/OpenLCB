<H1>Reliable Binary Wire Protocol</H1>
<P>This section describes carrying OpenLCB across a transport
mechanism that is reliable (all bytes are guaranteed to arrive in
their original order) and can carry binary bytes. 
</P>
<P>Examples of this include: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">TCP/IP point-to-point links 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">High-bandwidth wireless links 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Program-to-program links within computers 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Reliable binary links can carry the full OpenLCB protocol.
Messages are carried in full common format. 
</P>
<P>The reliable binary wire protocol is meant to attach multiple
segments of the entire OpenLCB instance. Using this protocol,
messages can be moved from one gateway to another, where one or more
additional OpenLCB nodes can be reached through the gateway(s). 
</P>
<P>It is meant for applications from attaching a single remote
console to interconnecting large modular layouts totaling 500 or more
segments and 10's of thousands of devices. As such, it must have no
addressing limitations beyond those built into the OpenLCB common
message format and node serial number format. 
</P>
<P>This wire protocol makes no assumptions about the available
bandwidth. In particular, it must work, with perhaps limited
effectiveness, when the link bandwidth is small compared to the
capacity on the other side of the gateways. 
</P>
<P>No assumption is made that this wire protocol is being used over
point-to-point connections. Broadcast and multicast connections
between nodes via this protocol are also permitted. 
</P>
<H2>Message Form</H2>
<P>Individual messages are preceded by a preamble that contains: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Originating gateway Node ID –
	the Node ID of the gateway that send/forwarded this message onto the
	point-to-point or multicast link. May or may not be the original
	source of the message.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Message capture time at
	originating gateway - a 64-bit number of monotonic milliseconds
	since (before) the connection was created; no time synchronization
	with other nodes implied; could have been a sequence number 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Flags - 16 bit quantity, the
	most-significant 15 bits are reserved. The least significant bit
	indicates whether the remaining message is a common OpenLCB message
	or a gateway-gateway communication. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Remaining message length in bytes 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Routing</H2>
<P>To reduce OpenLCB traffic on the individual OpenLCB segments, it's
useful to forward messages only to segments where nodes are listening
for them. The two ends of the gateway-gateway link can exchange
internal messages to control which common messages should be
forwarded over the link. 
</P>
<P><I>This entire section should probably move to the <A HREF="../notes/Routing.html">Note
on Routing</A>.</I> 
</P>
<H3>Addressed Messages</H3>
<P>Each gateway maintains a list of nodes (NIDs) that it knows are
present at the local end of the link, and a separate list of those
NIDs that can be reached via the remote end of the link. 
</P>
<P>When a node is seen on the local end: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The remote table is checked, and
	the NID removed if present. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The NID is placed in the local table if not present. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When a node is seen from the remote end: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The local table is checked, and
	the NID removed if present. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The NID is placed in the remote table if not present. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Messages arriving across the TCP/IP link are forwarded to the
local segment. (Nodes bouncing back and forth between “assigned to
local” and “assigned to remote” may indicate a routing loop;
nodes that do that just once may have been physically moved)</P>
<P>Messages with a destination Node ID (destination address) that are
seen on the local segment are checked to see where the node is
located. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it's remote, the message must
	be forwarded across the link. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it's local, the message can
	optionally be forwarded across the link or dropped. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If it's neither, e.g. not known, the message is forwarded,
	preceded by a &quot;Verify Node Serial Number (Addressed)&quot;
	message addressed to the same NID. This will eventually return a
	message from the node, resulting in routing table entries. Note that
	this is an unusual occurrence, which should only happen when a
	gateway comes up on an already operating OpenLCB. <I>(What's the
	utility of this? You have to forward the original message anyway, so
	that it's not lost, so what does this gain? Nothing for a
	point-to-point link, but if there are multiple remote destinations,
	e.g. a central scatter-gather, this allows the scatter to send the
	message only to the addressed node)</I></P>
</UL>
<H3>Unaddressed Messages</H3>
<P>Some unaddressed messages, such as &quot;Initialization Complete&quot;,
are rare enough that there is little cost to universally routing
them. That also provides operating nodes knowledge of all the other
nodes present on the OpenLCB. 
</P>
<P>Producer/Consumer Event Reports can be numerous enough that
complete routing would be excessive. The message itself doesn't show
an destination, however. A gateway can filter PCER messages from
outgoing transmission if it knows there is no node listening at the
remote end. To determine this, when a previously-unseen P/C Event ID
occurs, it can be routed over the link followed by a &quot;Identify
Consumers&quot; message with the same P/C Event ID. If any &quot;Consumer
Identity&quot; messages come back, this PCER must continue to be
routed. If none have returned after an appropriate time, the messages
need not be routed any longer. (This is needed to handle connecting
two live networks; adding a node emits the “Consumer
Identity/Identified” message automatically)</P>
<P>To allow live networks to be configured to use new P/C Event IDs,
gateways need to be able to restart routing of a P/C Event ID at a
later time. The &quot;Identified Consumer&quot; message triggers
this, and node are therefore required to emit an &quot;Identify
Consmer&quot; message when they first attach to the OpenLCB or if
they are configured to consume a new Event Id. When an &quot;Identified
Consumer&quot; is received from the remote side, PCER messages with
that P/C Event ID must in the future be routed from the local side to
the remote side. 
</P>
<H3>Issues to Resolve</H3>
<P>The routing discussion doesn't properly handle routing loops, e.g.
a TCP/IP link with both ends on the same CAN segment. Most can be
detected by seeing the same source Node ID coming from two different
links or passing onto a segment that originates that same Node ID,
but can all can be detected that way?</P>
<P>A time-to-live field is probably needed for detecting routing
problems, but how to transfer it across e.g. intermediate CAN
segments? Is that required? 
</P>
<P>As an alternative to time-to-live, and as a way to detect and
diagnose loops, each forwarding gateway could add a new messages
header (instead of replacing the old one) of node, time and flags.
One of the flags would be whether the content started with another
header, so that this could be broken apart. This still doesn't detect
loops that involve CAN segments, where these headers are lost, so
maybe it's not worth it.</P>
<P>There needs to be a standard way to command remote gateway
configuration, e.g. to set a &quot;send everything, I want to see it
all&quot;. That has to work on a IP-CAN-IP-CAN-IP multisegment link,
so has to be done with common messages. 
</P>
<H2>Gateway-Gateway Messages</H2>
<P>The TCP/IP gateway to gateway links effectively partition the
overall OpenLCB into smaller &quot;islands&quot; or &quot;subnets&quot;.
OpenLCB nodes in any of these must be able to communicate with each
other, including over intermediate wire-protocols that differ. 
</P>

</P>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Section contains work in progress,
notes-to-self, and background information. 
</P>
<H3>Relationship with Ethernet Connections</H3>
<P>Imagine you have five OpenLCB CAN segments, connected by small
boxes to an Ethernet: You can use an Ethernet-specific protocol (e.g.
ala Ethertalk, etc), or you can use IP connections (probably TCP/IP).</P>
<P>The TCP/IP solution seems to require more overhead, but it works
about the same on a single Ethernet segment and across multiple
segments, wide area links, etc.</P>
<P>The Ethernet-protocol solution seems somewhat simpler (though
getting a protocol certified is a lot of work), but can't get traffic
off the local Ethernet segment. It spans hubs, but not switches, and
would require OpenLCB-specific devices to connect to the larger
Internet. So although an Ethernet-specific protocol seems simpler to
create, in practice you'd still need to create Ethernet to Internet
routers, resulting in an overall increase in engineering effort.</P>
<P>Where Ethernet-specific protocol might be useful is in reducing
the configuration load for single-segment implementations. It would
be nice if people could plug e.g. five OpenLCB CAN-Ethernet adapters
into a single Ethernet and have them find and configure themselves to
interconnect. This doesn't require new OpenLCB-specific protocols;
it's much more likely that a robust solution could be created using
e.g. Bonjour (a form of ZeroConf) and similar standard protocols.
Some recommendations here would improve interoperability of
implementing devices.</P>
<P>These ideas are being developed in <A HREF="../notes/Ethernet.html">another
document</A>.</P>

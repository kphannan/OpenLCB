<H1>Reliable Binary Wire Protocol</H1>
<P>This section describes carrying OpenLCB across a transport
mechanism that is reliable (all bytes are guaranteed to arrive in
their original order) and can carry binary bytes. 
</P>
<P>Examples of this include: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">TCP/IP point-to-point links 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">High-bandwidth wireless links 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Program-to-program links within computers 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Reliable binary links can carry the full OpenLCB protocol.
Messages are carried in full common format. 
</P>
<P>The reliable binary wire protocol is meant to attach multiple
segments of the entire OpenLCB instance. Using this protocol,
messages can be moved from one gateway to another, where one or more
additional OpenLCB nodes can be reached through the gateway(s). 
</P>
<P>It is meant for applications from attaching a single remote
console to interconnecting large modular layouts totaling 500 or more
segments and 10's of thousands of devices. As such, it must have no
addressing limitations beyond those built into the OpenLCB common
message format and node serial number format. 
</P>
<P>This wire protocol makes no assumptions about the available
bandwidth. In particular, it must work, with perhaps limited
effectiveness, when the link bandwidth is small compared to the
capacity on the other side of the gateways. 
</P>
<P>No assumption is made that this wire protocol is being used over
point-to-point connections. Broadcast and multicast connections
between nodes via this protocol are also permitted. 
</P>
<H2>Message Form</H2>
<P>Individual messages are preceded by a preamble that contains: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Originating gateway Node ID –
	the Node ID of the gateway that send/forwarded this message onto the
	point-to-point or multicast link. May or may not be the original
	source of the message.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Message capture time at
	originating gateway - a 64-bit number of monotonic milliseconds
	since (before) the connection was created; no time synchronization
	with other nodes implied; could have been a sequence number 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Flags - 16 bit quantity, the
	most-significant 15 bits are reserved. The least significant bit
	indicates whether the remaining message is a common OpenLCB message
	or a gateway-gateway communication. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Remaining message length in bytes</P>
</UL>
<H2>Gateway-Gateway Messages</H2>
<P>The TCP/IP gateway to gateway links effectively partition the
overall OpenLCB into smaller &quot;islands&quot; or &quot;subnets&quot;.
OpenLCB nodes in any of these must be able to communicate with each
other, including over intermediate wire-protocols that differ. 
</P>
<P>Gateway-to-gateway messages (will be) defined to control
operation.  Note that these are not available on e.g. CAN links.</P>
<P>Possible uses: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Turning filtering on and off in gateways so that messages can
	be forwarded for logging.  
	</P>
	<LI><P>Turning logging on and off.</P>
	<LI><P>Redirecting point-to-point links: “I'm going offline now,
	you should connection to him”</P>
	<LI><P>Negotiating buffer sizes and traffic levels; flow control.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">(<I>More needed here, most likely</I>) 
</P>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Section contains work in progress,
notes-to-self, and background information. 
</P>
<H3>Relationship with Ethernet Connections</H3>
<P>Imagine you have five OpenLCB CAN segments, connected by small
boxes to an Ethernet: You can use an Ethernet-specific protocol (e.g.
ala Ethertalk, etc), or you can use IP connections (probably TCP/IP).</P>
<P>The TCP/IP solution seems to require more overhead, but it works
about the same on a single Ethernet segment and across multiple
segments, wide area links, etc.</P>
<P>The Ethernet-protocol solution seems somewhat simpler (though
getting a protocol certified is a lot of work), but can't get traffic
off the local Ethernet segment. It spans hubs, but not switches, and
would require OpenLCB-specific devices to connect to the larger
Internet. So although an Ethernet-specific protocol seems simpler to
create, in practice you'd still need to create Ethernet to Internet
routers, resulting in an overall increase in engineering effort.</P>
<P>Where Ethernet-specific protocol might be useful is in reducing
the configuration load for single-segment implementations. It would
be nice if people could plug e.g. five OpenLCB CAN-Ethernet adapters
into a single Ethernet and have them find and configure themselves to
interconnect. This doesn't require new OpenLCB-specific protocols;
it's much more likely that a robust solution could be created using
e.g. Bonjour (a form of ZeroConf) and similar standard protocols.
Some recommendations here would improve interoperability of
implementing devices.</P>
<P>These ideas are being developed in <A HREF="../notes/Ethernet.html">another
document</A>.</P>

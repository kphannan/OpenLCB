<H1>Unique Node ID Assignment</H1>
<P>The proposed OpenLCB uses globally unique idenfiers (UIDs),
particularly for 
Node ID numbers (NIDs).
This node discusses the assignment of those. 
There are is a draft OpenLCB 
Standard
(<a href="../specs/drafts/GenUniqueIdS.pdf">.pdf</a>, 
<a href="../specs/drafts/GenUniqueIdS.odt">.odt</a>)
and 
Technical Note
(<a href="../specs/drafts/GenUniqueIdTN.pdf">.pdf</a>, 
<a href="../specs/drafts/GenUniqueIdTN.odt">.odt</a>)
that also addresses this more formally.
</P>
<P>The &quot;globally unique&quot; requirement only refers to the
universe of connected nodes; nodes that never need to communicate
with each other need not use separate UIDs
or have separate NIDs. In general, however,
nodes can move: They can be sold or loaned for use on another layout,
nodes on modular layouts can be connected to other arbitrary modules,
and few assumptions can be made. It's best if nodes are given a
completely unique ID when manufactured, so there's no need to ever
detect and resolve a conflict. 
</P>
<P>Unique IDs are assigned via a delegation process. At the highest
level, number ranges are assigned to people and organizations, within
which they are responsible for assigning unique numbers to separate
devices. These ranges can be subdivided and delegated further, as
needed. Additional ranges can then be requested, which will be
recorded here or eventually in some online system accessible to
anybody. 
</P>
<P>Anyone may request a block of IDs of a suitable size, which are
then automatically assigned. It is preferred that this be an easy
process, perhaps just filling out a web form, so that people can
rapidly obtain and use unique IDs. For now, all assignments are
documented in a web-accessible spreadsheet 
(<A HREF="UniqueIdAllocations.ods">.ods</A>)
(<A HREF="UniqueIdAllocations.pdf">.pdf</A>).</P>
<P>In addition to ranges directly delegated by the central authority,
there are several special-case populations of modules: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Numbers assigned by manufacturers 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Numbers assigned by members of
	organized groups 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Numbers assigned by do-it-yourself
	hobbyists 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Numbers assigned by software at run-time 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>One of the reasons for having a long, 48-bit NID space is to make
it easier to have alternative approaches like this. Particular
assignments for these populations are discussed below. In each table,
the blank bytes on the left (most significant bytes) will be assigned
fixed values for distinguishing the various types. 
</P>
<P>In these delegated assignments, the lower order byte(s) are
self-assigned. The values of zero is reserved, indicating that a
number within the range hasn't been assigned. 
</P>

<H2>Appendix - Private IP Addresses</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>(There is much more information in a
<A HREF="notes/NetworkingBackground.html">separate background
document</A>, and this information should be moved there â€“ Bob)</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<PRE>There are three ranges of IP addresses that are &quot;private&quot;:

10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (2^24 addresses)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (2^16 addresses)
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (2^16 addresses)

In addition, a range is reserved for the Windows 
&quot;Automatic Private IP Addressing&quot; feature:
169.254.0.0 -169.254.255.255 (2^16 addresses)

The A/B/C class system:
A has 0XXX,XXXX in 1st octet (0-127) and allocates 24-bit ranges
B has 10XX,XXXX in 1st octet (128-191) and allocates 16-bit ranges
C has 110X,XXXX in 1st octet (192-223) and allocates 8-bit ranges
D has 111X,XXXX in 1st octet (224-255) and is used for multicast, etc.

But the regularity this defines is used for routing, something not needed in the much smaller OpenLCB network.

EUI-48 addresses (used to be known as MAC addresses) are 46 bits (48, but two of them indicate global/local and other use).</PRE>

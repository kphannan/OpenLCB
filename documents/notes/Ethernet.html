<H1>Note: The Role of Ethernet</H1>
<P>Imagine you have five OpenLCB CAN segments, connected by small
boxes to an Ethernet: You can use an Ethernet-specific protocol (e.g.
ala Ethertalk, etc), or you can use IP connections (probably TCP/IP).</P>
<P>The TCP/IP solution seems to require more overhead, but it works
about the same on a single Ethernet segment and across multiple
segments, wide area links, etc.</P>
<P>The Ethernet-protocol solution seems somewhat simpler (though
getting a protocol certified is a lot of work), but can't get traffic
off the local Ethernet segment. It spans hubs, but not switches, and
would require OpenLCB-specific devices to connect to the larger
Internet. So although an Ethernet-specific protocol seems simpler to
create, in practice you'd still need to create Ethernet to Internet
routers, resulting in an overall increase in engineering effort.</P>
<P>Where Ethernet-specific protocol might be useful is in reducing
the configuration load for single-segment implementations. It would
be nice if people could plug e.g. five OpenLCB CAN-Ethernet adapters
into a single Ethernet and have them find and configure themselves to
interconnect. This doesn't require new OpenLCB-specific protocols;
it's much more likely that a robust solution could be created using
e.g. Bonjour (a form of ZeroConf) and similar standard protocols.
Some recommendations here would improve interoperability of
implementing devices.</P>
<P>The rest of this note is where we develop that.</P>

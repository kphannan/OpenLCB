<H1>Note: The Role of Ethernet</H1>
<P>Imagine you have five OpenLCB CAN segments, connected by small
boxes to an Ethernet: You can use an Ethernet-specific protocol (e.g.
ala Ethertalk, etc), or you can use IP connections (probably TCP/IP).</P>
<P>The TCP/IP solution seems to require more overhead, but it works
about the same on a single Ethernet segment and across multiple
segments, wide area links, etc.</P>
<P>The Ethernet-protocol solution seems somewhat simpler (though
getting a protocol certified is a lot of work), but can't get traffic
off the local Ethernet segment. It spans hubs, but not switches, and
would require OpenLCB-specific devices to connect to the larger
Internet. So although an Ethernet-specific protocol seems simpler to
create, in practice you'd still need to create Ethernet to Internet
routers, resulting in an overall increase in engineering effort.</P>
<P>Where Ethernet-specific protocol might be useful is in reducing
the configuration load for single-segment implementations. It would
be nice if people could plug e.g. five OpenLCB CAN-Ethernet adapters
into a single Ethernet and have them find and configure themselves to
interconnect. This doesn't require new OpenLCB-specific protocols;
it's much more likely that a robust solution could be created using
e.g. Bonjour (a form of ZeroConf) and similar standard protocols.
Some recommendations here would improve interoperability of
implementing devices.</P>
<P>The rest of this note is where we develop that.</P>
<H2>Environment of Proposal</H2>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Only use well-known, publicly available, commonly implemented
	protocols</P>
	<LI><P>Simple self-configuration is required</P>
	<LI><P>Must interoperate with all common PC-like computer types:
	Windows, Mac, Linux</P>
	<LI><P>UDP/IP is not a sufficiently reliable protocol for use with
	PCs.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Preferences</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Must be straightforward to implement in low cost, low
	capability devices</P>
	<LI><P>Conformance must be testable with reasonable infrastructure.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Design Choices</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Use Bonjour/Zeroconf to provide DNS and IP address assignment
	in the absence of any other network infrastructure, e.g. when
	creating an ad-hoc network.</P>
	<LI><P>Use Bonjour/Zeroconf to advertise and access services.</P>
	<LI><P>Use TCP/IP instead of UDP/IP.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>In the following, “node” means an OpenLCB node with a native
Ethernet connection.  This node might be e.g. a gateway to an entire
CAN segment, but that doesn't matter to this discussion.</P>
<P>Two types of connections are provided:  “point-to-point” and
“hub-and-spoke”.</P>
<P>In “point-to-point”, two nodes are connected by a direct
TCP/IP connection.  This works fine for e.g. two nodes, but using
only point-to-point connections doesn't scale well.  If there are 10
nodes present, each has to maintain 9 TCP/IP sessions, which is
rapidly becoming impractical. On the other hand, it's the simplest
possible TCP/IP code.</P>
<P>In the “hub-and-spoke” connection, one node acts as a “hub”
and all others connect to it as “spokes”.  Each spoke node sends
traffic to the hub, and the hub then forwards it to the N-2 other
nodes.</P>
<H3>Protocol</H3>
<P>When a node comes up, it enquires for a “_openlcb-hub._tcp.local.”
service. If found, connect to it.</P>
<P>If not found, and if the node can be a hub (it's not required that
all nodes be able to do that), it configures itself to act as a hub
and advertises the “_openlcb-hub._tcp.local.” service.  Since all
that takes time, it then checks again for <U>another</U> node
advertising to be a hub. If found, it drops back to connecting to
that and removes its service if the connection succeeds.</P>
<P>If all that fails, start advertising as
“_openlcb-node._tcp.local.”. Then, check for any other node(s)
advertising as “_openlcb-node._tcp.local.” and connect to as many
as possible of the ones that are found.</P>

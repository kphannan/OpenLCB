<h1>Optional Interactions</h1>

These interactions need not be implemented.
If they are, they must work at least as described here.

<a name="configuration">
<h2>Configuration</h2>

Determining the type information from a node is a standard (required)
interaction.  Doing the configuration via the NMRAnet is optional, but
most vendors will want to provide it.


<p>
Basic architecture: configuration is a vector of setting values, 
which is described by higher-level format information that's available 
directly from the node. 

The configuration vector doesn't have to 
be organized the same as it's stored in the device, but it 
certainly can be.


<i><p>Do we want to provide both a low-rate, simple protocol
plus a higher-speed streaming version?</i>

<h3>Read Configuration Format</h3>

Uses a stream to pull data describing the content of the
configuration date.

<h3>Read Configuration Data</h3>

Uses a stream to pull all the configuration data.

<h3>Write Configuration Data</h3>

Uses a stream to put a new set of configuration data.

<h2>Streaming Interactions</h2>

NMRAnet provides a streaming protocol for moving large quantities
of data.  Nodes must implement the standard interaction for streaming,
which is just enough to gracefully turn down a streaming request.
They may optionally implement streaming for one or more of several 
purposes.

<h3>Read/Write Configuration</h3>

See the <a href="#configuration">configuration section</a>.

<h3>Reload/Update Software</h3>

<h3>Move Sound/Video</h3>

<i>(The key part to this is a bandwidth allocation scheme via gateways,
in addition to the existing buffer space allocation)</i>

<h3>Bulk Data</h3>

<i><p>Can a node request a download, e.g. of a large amount of volative 
context information stored elsewhere, on a higher-capability node?  If
so, is that addressed?  Or global, with requesting NID as part of a key?</i>

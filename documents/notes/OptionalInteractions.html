<H1>Optional Interactions</H1>
<P><A NAME="configuration"></A>These interactions need not be
implemented. If they are, they must work at least as described here. 
</P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>
<P>Determining the type information from a node is a standard
(required) interaction. Doing the configuration via the OpenLCB is
optional, but most vendors will want to provide it. 
</P>
<P>Basic architecture: configuration is a vector of setting values,
which is described by higher-level format information that's
available directly from the node. The configuration vector doesn't
have to be organized the same as it's stored in the device, but it
certainly can be. 
</P>
<P><I>Do we want to provide both a low-rate, simple protocol plus a
higher-speed streaming version?</I> 
</P>
<H3>Read Configuration Format</H3>
<P>Uses a stream to pull data describing the content of the
configuration date. 
</P>
<H3>Read Configuration Data</H3>
<P>Uses a stream to pull all the configuration data. 
</P>
<H3>Write Configuration Data</H3>
<P>Uses a stream to put a new set of configuration data. 
</P>
<H2>Streaming Interactions</H2>
<P>OpenLCB provides a streaming protocol for moving large quantities
of data. Nodes must implement the standard interaction for streaming,
which is just enough to gracefully turn down a streaming request.
They may optionally implement streaming for one or more of several
purposes. 
</P>
<H3>Read/Write Configuration</H3>
<P>See the <A HREF="#configuration">configuration section</A>. 
</P>
<H3>Reload/Update Software</H3>
<H3>Move Sound/Video</H3>
<P><I>(The key part to this is a bandwidth allocation scheme via
gateways, in addition to the existing buffer space allocation)</I> 
</P>
<H3>Bulk Data</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Can a node request a download, e.g.
of a large amount of volative context information stored elsewhere,
on a higher-capability node? If so, is that addressed? Or global,
with requesting NID as part of a key?</I>

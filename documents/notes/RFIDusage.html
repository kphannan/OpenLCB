<H1>Note: RFID and OpenLCB</H1>
<P>Notes from an email discussion in November 2009 about use of RFID
tags with OpenLCB.</P>
<H3>Mike Johnson</H3>
<P>My next question is about RFID tags, the 64 bit tags have 40 bits
of data.
The EM4102 spec seems to have a 32 bit global unique number
plus an 8 bit version/user code.
So it seems that a minimum size for
an event would be 6 byte NID + 4 bytes of tag. (Pity the NID was not
4 bytes, so it could all fit in one packet as an 8 byte event).

</P>
<P>I'm thinking that it would be nice if the RFID tag event could be
used like
any other event to select a route for a train or turn on an
LED.
</P>
<P>But, an RFID reader can only send the tag, with the NIDa in the
header
needing to be translated to a full NID by a consumer. Perhaps
translating an
RFID tag event to a normal event needs to be done by a
larger node or PC.

Have RFID tags been considered ? 
</P>
<H3>Bob Jacobsen</H3>
<P>There's a brief mention of them in the Datagram
doc:
&lt;<A HREF="http://openlcb.sourceforge.net/trunk/documents/DatagramProtocol.html">http://openlcb.sourceforge.net/trunk/documents/DatagramProtocol.html</A>&gt;

</P>
<P>The idea there was that they'd be sending information from a point
to a point, e.g. reporting to a central yard processor as a train
arrives, so a datagram was fine.

</P>
<P>If one wants to put both tag and location in a single 8 byte
event, you certainly can, you just can't use the node ID to do it. 
So how to allocate the 64-40 or 64-32 other bits?  

</P>
<P>Since the source NodeID is carried _separately_ from the EventID
in every produced-event message, one approach would be to define a
unique upper 24 or 32 bits for &quot;RFID Event&quot;, and then key
location to the source NodeID (reserving that much space for
well-known events is easy, since you're really only reserving a small
part of it).  You could even allocate a little more space if desired,
e.g. for an extra couple of status bits, but you can't go too far
that way.

useful)</P>

<P>Simple nodes are defined as the leaf nodes that do basic layout
control (input/output) operations.  Gateways, configuration tools and
other network-aware nodes are not simple nodes.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Messages Transmitted</H2>
<P>Simple nodes may transmit any message, which must propagate
correctly. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Messages Received</H2>
<P>Simple nodes must receive any message addressed to them, plus the
following unaddressed global messages:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Verify Node ID – They need to receive this so that they can
	reply to it.</P>
	<LI><P>Verified Node ID – They need to receive this because it's
	the reply to their own request, which might be used to e.g. locate a
	node for delayed sending of status</P>
	<LI><P>Protocol Support Inquiry – They need to receive this so
	that they can reply to it.</P>
	<LI><P>Protocol Support Reply - ?? Should this be here ??</P>
	<LI><P>Identify Consumers, Identify Producers, Identify Events –
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">because</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>
	others will ask this of them</P>
	<LI><P>Learn Event – so they can be programmed</P>
	<LI><P>P/C Event Report – what they do for a living</P>
</UL>
<P>In the future, additional MTIs will be defined. If simple nodes
need to received them, the MTI will indicate that; see the MTI
Allocation TN.  
</P>
<P>Gateways <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">that</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>
are serving network segments (e.g. single CAN segments) that contain
only simple nodes may suppress unaddressed (global) messages that do
not contain simple-node MTIs.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Messages Not Received</H2>
<P>Messages not listed in the section above do not need to be
received by simple nodes.</P>
<P>A brief description of why the following message types are not
necessary for simple nodes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Initialization Complete: Used to indicate that a node is
	newly available to the network. Simple nodes only care about their
	specific tasks, and by definition are not interested in the overall
	structure and availability of the network.</P>
	<LI><P>Consumer Identified, Consumer Identify Range: These are of
	interest to gateways and configuration tools, but an individual
	producer does not need to know which (if any) nodes are consuming
	its produced events.</P>
	<LI><P>Producer Identified, Producer Identify Range: These are of
	interest to gateways and configuration tools, but an individual
	consumer does not need to know which (if any) nodes are producing
	its consumed events.</P>
</UL>

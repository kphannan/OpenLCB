<H1>Ident Method(s)</H1>
<P>Users may want to be able to identify a specific board (node) to a
configuration tool.</P>
<P>This note is a working draft proposal.</P>
<H2>Use Cases</H2>
<P>A user wants to use a configuration tool to configure a new input
on node A, located under the far end of the layout. He presses button
on the node, and the tool learns which node (specifically, the Node
ID).</P>
<P>A user walks from module to module on a modular layout, pressing
buttons. A configuration tool sees the sequence of button presses and
checks it against the expected module-to-module connections.</P>
<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>There are (at least) four ways of doing this, each with advantages
and disadvantages.</P>
<H3>Dedicated Node-Specific Event</H3>
<P>One way to provide an “ident” capability would be to define a
specific EventID that nodes produce to identify themselves. For
example, reserving 0xFF,FF in the lower bytes, with the NodeID in the
upper bytes, would give a unique indication that an ident button was
pressed.</P>
<H4>Advantages</H4>
<P>The identification messages need to propagate across the entire
LCB. P/C Events are the OpenLCB general mechanism for doing this. 
</P>
<H4>Disadvantages</H4>
<P>Makes the event address space a lot less orthogonal.</P>
<P>Don't want every node to emit a “produces” or “consumes”
message for general event IDs, so would have to build that in as a
special case (this is an issue just beyond this use of generic
EventID signaling, but more significant here because this eventID has
to have the NodeID in the top 6 bytes, so it's space is small)</P>
<H3>Dedicated Global Event</H3>
<P>We could define a global eventID that indicates “ident”; the
source ID would then provide the information needed to track down the
source.</P>
<H4>Advantages</H4>
<P>Small footprint, stays orthogonal.</P>
<H4>Disadvantages</H4>
<P>Requires the global eventID space be implemented, specifically in
routers and gateways.</P>
<P>Requires central allocation of the EventID, but this only needs to
be done once.</P>
<H3>Configuration Message</H3>
<P>A specific form of configuration message within the <A HREF="ConfigurationProtocol.html">configuration
protocol</A> can be reserved for this.</P>
<P>The configuration protocol already has a “confirm” mechanism
to signal the proper board by e.g. lighting a light. Being able to
send a message back via button push, so that the configuration tool
can get positive confirmation of the right board, would be useful.</P>
<H4>Advantages</H4>
<P>The configuration protocol already has a “confirm” mechanism
to signal the proper board by e.g. lighting a light. Being able to
send a message back via button push, so that the configuration tool
can get positive confirmation of the right board, would be useful.</P>
<H4>Disadvantages</H4>
<P>Since the configuration protocol is point-to-point, the node with
the button press needs to find out where to send the message. It's
not all clear how to solve this. It's not practical to “write all
nodes so they know you want to hear when their button is pressed”.</P>
<H3>Dedicated Message Type</H3>
<P>A specific OpenLCB message type could be defined for this, with a
specific MTI. This could then be specified to propogate as needed.</P>
<H4>Advantages</H4>
<P>Can specify it exactly, without compromise.</P>
<H4>Disadvantages</H4>
<P>MTIs are eventually a scarce resource.</P>
<P>Another special case in code. This is not an incredibly large
issue, as simple nodes need only emit a fixed message, and routing
nodes just pass it through.</P>

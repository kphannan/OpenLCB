<P>On first blush, model railroads appear to be only about running a
train around some track.  Then people next focus on how the train is
controlled, is it 'DC', where  it is  controlled by the voltage on
the track, or is it 'DCC', or Digital Command Control, where the
trains are controlled by sending commands along the rails to the
engine.  The next foucus is often adding scenery and points of
interest on the layout, such as lakes and buildings.  
</P>
<P>However, even on small layouts, the layout designer will soon want
to add some interesting accessories, such as lighting, powered
turnouts (points), crossing gates, sound, and automation.    This is
where OpenLCB comes in.  OpenLCB is designed to let you control your
model railroad accessories in a simple manner, yet is powerful enough
to expand to control very large layouts, such as museums or modular
clubs.  
</P>
<P>OpenLCB is named because it is a 'Local Control Bus' that is
developed as an open-source standard.  That is, there are no fees for
using the design, but it is standardized so that, even though they
may superficially operate different, products from different
companies will work together.  
</P>
<P>OpenLCB equipment is designed to connect together using a 'bus',
which is a bundle of  wires that lets the equipment 'talk' to each
other.  Each piece of equipment is called a 'node', and the
connecting wires are called a 'bus'.  
</P>
<P>Simple layouts will only need several simple nodes, perhaps some
to control the turnouts or points on your layout.  To do this you
would buy one or more turnout-controller nodes and some form of
control panel node, such as a multi-button node.  In addition, you
would need to buy a power supply.  Usually for small layouts you only
have to power one of the nodes, as the others will get their power
from the bus wires.  
</P>
<P>After you have connected the nodes together as per their
instructions, the nodes all listen on the bus, which acts as a
party-line.  When something happens on the layout, such as you
pushing a button, the button-node will send a message down the bus
that the button was pushed.  Other nodes can be taught to hear that
message and cause something else to happen, such as turn on a light,
change a signal, or move a turnout.  
</P>
<P>Teaching a node to respond differs depending on the node, but the
usual process is to select a number of nodes to listen and also what
action they should take when the message is received, such as moving
a turnout to a specific direction.  Then another node is selected to
teach these nodes when a 'trigger' occurs, in this case when as
button is pushed.  After the teaching, whenever the trigger occurs,
the button is pushed, then trigger -node sends a message along the
bus to the listening-nodes, which cause their actions to happen, the
turnout is moved.  This whole package of trigger and actions is
called an event.  
</P>
<P>This process has its own terminology.  This whole package of
trigger and actions is called Producer/Consumer Model, and the
message is called an event.  The triggering-node is called a
producer, because it produces the event, and the action-node is call
the consumer, because it 'consumes' the event.  
</P>
<P>The Producer/Consumer, or P/C, Model is very powerful.  It allows
one or more producers to cause zero or more consumers to cause
actions.  However, its real power comes form the fact that neither
the producers, no the consumers, need to know about any of the
others.  While it is obvious that a button press might cause a
turnout to go to the closed position, a single event might allow two
buttons at opposite ends of teh layout to control twenty-five
turnouts to set a route.  Events can represent such abstract concepts
as “Set the lighting to dawn”, or “Set the layout to mainline
running”, which can effect multiple different equipment on the
layout.  
</P>
<P>While OpenLCB is simple to operate and to teach events to, it
really shines as your layout grows.  All things have limits and
eventually you will have more nodes than a single bus can contain. 
This will be anywhere from 25-75 nodes.  At that point, you can
simply divide you bus into two bus-segments, and join them with a
bus-repeater.  The problem is that any bus segment will be limited by
getting too long, having too many nodes, too much activity, or
needing too much power.   By dividing the bus in two you make two
segments that are shorter, have less nodes, and need less power.  The
bus-repeater node simply joins the two halves together.  The
important point is that you do not have to change anything else.  All
your programming is intact and you can just continue as you were.  
</P>
<P>However, at any point, you may want to take advantage of some of
the other features that OpenLCB offers.  OpenLCB is the ability to
connect legacy model railroad equipment that you may own, for
example, you can connect to DCC, Loconet, Xpressnet, C\MRI, etc. 
These nodes are called 'bridges' and come in a variety of flavours,
depending on what you need.  
</P>
<P>A bus-repeater is a simple 'bridge' node, it just sends all the
activity on one segment to the other.  You may have noticed  above
that dividing your bus into two segments did not reduce the bus
activity.  Fancier bridges are available that can not only connect
segments together but can reduce the activity on each of them to only
those messages that are useful to each segment.  
</P>
<P>One such bridge connects the bus to Ethernet – this actually
runs OpenLCB on ethernet allowing you not only to connect your
computer, but connect to the wider world via the internet.  Using
ethernet is most useful to larger layouts because it lets them join
many bus-segments together, since ethernet has a higher  'bandwidth'
and can easily handle the activity of many segments.  
</P>
<P>However, the biggest advantage to OpenLCB is not apparent unless
you compare it to other buses.  Other buses require the user to
choose 'node IDs' and to ensure that no node has the same ID.  This
is quite easy on small layouts, reasonable of\n larger layouts, but
becomes almost impossible on very large layouts or layouts that are
put together in an ad hoc manner, such as occurs at large meets of
modular groups, such as Fremo, Free-mo, Ntrak, oNeTrak, etc.  OpenLCB
makes putting together these layouts reasonably painless and
efficient.  Together with other advanced features, OpenLCB lets these
groups focus on enjoying their massive layouts.

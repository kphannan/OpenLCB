<P><FONT SIZE=4>On first blush, model railroads appear to be only
about running a train around a track.  People then focus on how the
train is controlled: is it 'DC', where the the trains are controlled
by the voltage on the track; or is it 'DCC' (Digital Command
Control), where they are controlled by  commands sent through the
rails to the engine. The next focus is often the scenery and points
of static interest on the layout, such as lakes and buildings. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>However, even on small layouts, the layout designer
will soon want to add some interesting active accessories, such as
lighting, powered turnouts (points), crossing gates, sound, and
automation. Often these things are controlled manually, but this soon
becomes tiresome, and it would be much nicer if the turnouts can be
managed from a distance, or from two locations.  This is possible,
but most layouts become a maze of wires, and become hard to maintain
and extend.  </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>This is where OpenLCB comes in. OpenLCB is a set of
components that are designed to let you control your model railroad
accessories in a simple manner, with less wiring.  It is useful on
even small layouts, but is powerful enough to control very large
layouts, such as those in museums or built by modular clubs. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>OpenLCB stands for 'Open Local Control Bus'.  The
Open-part declares that it is developed as an open-source standard –
that is, there are no fees for using the design, but it is
standardized so that products from different companies will work
together, even though they may superficially operate differently.  </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>OpenLCB is implemented as a set of units called
'nodes' which take inputs such as push-buttons and BODS and control
outputs such as lights and switch-machines.  The nodes send messages
to each other using a bundle of wires run between them called a
'bus', that acts as a party line.  As a result of the messages, the
nodes can control the elements on the layout such as switch-machines
and lights.  </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>It is helpful to describe how OpenLCB might help the
novice and expert model railroader.  Simple layouts will likely have
only few nodes, for example to control turnouts (points) on the
layout by way of push-buttons.  In this case, one would buy one or
more OpenLCB turnout-controller nodes and a panel node, such as a
multi-button node, and a power supply.  After the nodes are connected
together with the bus cables, as per their instructions, and are
powered on, the nodes will all listen on the bus, but nothing
apparent will happen if you push the buttons.  When you push a
button, the button-node does send a message on the bus that indicated
that the button was pushed.  Other nodes can be taught to respond to
that message by causing something to happen, such as turning on a
light, changing a signal, or moving a turnout. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Teaching a node to respond differs depending on the
node, but the usual process is to select a number of 'learning' nodes
to listen and also what action they should take when the message is
received, such as moving a turnout to a specific direction. Then
another 'teaching' node is selected to teach these nodes when the
'trigger' occurs, in this case when as button is pushed. After the
teaching, whenever the trigger occurs, ie the button is pushed, the
trigger-node sends a message along the bus to the listening-nodes,
which cause their actions to happen, and the turnout is moved. This
whole package of trigger and actions is called an event. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>This process has its own terminology: the whole
package of triggers, messages, and actions is called the
'Producer/Consumer Model'; the  actual message is called an 'event';
the triggering-node is called a 'producer', because it produces the
event; and the action-node is call the 'consumer', because it
consumes the event.   </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The Producer/Consumer, or P/C, Model is very
powerful. It allows one or more producers to cause zero or more
consumers to cause actions. However, its real power comes form the
fact that neither the producers, no the consumers, need to know about
any of the others. While it is obvious that a button press might
cause a turnout to go to the closed position, a single event might
allow two buttons at opposite ends of teh layout to control
twenty-five turnouts to set a route. Events can represent such
abstract concepts as “Set the lighting to dawn”, or “Set the
layout to mainline running”, which can effect multiple different
equipment on the layout. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>While OpenLCB is simple to operate and to teach
events to, it really shines as your layout grows. All things have
limits and eventually you will have more nodes than a single bus can
contain. This will be anywhere from 25-75 nodes. At that point, you
can simply divide you bus into two bus-segments, and join them with a
bus-repeater. The problem is that any bus segment will be limited by
getting too long, having too many nodes, too much activity, or
needing too much power. By dividing the bus in two you make two
segments that are shorter, have less nodes, and need less power. The
bus-repeater node simply joins the two halves together. The important
point is that you do not have to change anything else. All your
programming is intact and you can just continue as you were. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>However, at any point, you may want to take advantage
of some of the other features that OpenLCB offers. OpenLCB is the
ability to connect legacy model railroad equipment that you may own,
for example, you can connect to DCC, Loconet, Xpressnet, C\MRI, etc.
These nodes are called 'bridges' and come in a variety of flavours,
depending on what you need. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>A bus-repeater is a simple 'bridge' node, it just
sends all the activity on one segment to the other. You may have
noticed above that dividing your bus into two segments did not reduce
the bus activity. Fancier bridges are available that can not only
connect segments together but can reduce the activity on each of them
to only those messages that are useful to each segment. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>One such bridge connects the bus to Ethernet – this
actually runs OpenLCB on ethernet allowing you not only to connect
your computer, but connect to the wider world via the internet. Using
ethernet is most useful to larger layouts because it lets them join
many bus-segments together, since ethernet has a higher 'bandwidth'
and can easily handle the activity of many segments. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>However, the biggest advantage to OpenLCB is not
apparent unless you compare it to other buses. Other buses require
the user to choose 'node IDs' and to ensure that no node has the same
ID. This is quite easy on small layouts, reasonable of\n larger
layouts, but becomes almost impossible on very large layouts or
layouts that are put together in an ad hoc manner, such as occurs at
large meets of modular groups, such as Fremo, Free-mo, Ntrak,
oNeTrak, etc. OpenLCB makes putting together these layouts reasonably
painless and efficient. Together with other advanced features,
OpenLCB lets these groups focus on enjoying their massive layouts. </FONT>

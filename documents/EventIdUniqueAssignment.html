<H1>OpenLCB Unique Event ID Assignment</H1>
<P>The proposed OpenLCB depends on globally unique Event ID numbers
(EIDs). This node discusses the assignment of those. 
</P>
<P>The &quot;globally unique&quot; requirement only refers to the
universe of connected nodes; nodes that never need to communicate
with each other don't need to have separate Event IDs. In general,
however, nodes can move: They can be sold or loaned for use on
another layout, nodes on modular layouts can be connected to other
arbitrary modules, and few assumptions can be made. Therefore, we
require globally uniqueness for all EventIDs.</P>
<P>To ensure uniqueness, the top 6 bytes of EventIDs that you define
are <U>required</U> to be within the NodeID space that you control.
The low two bytes would be any number you prefer, so long as you use
each value for only one event.</P>
<P>This requirement applies equally to events defined by a hardware
node, e.g. by button pushing, a software node in a computer, or
EventIDs that are defined by a human writing them on a piece of
paper. In each case, the thing doing the definition must ensure it
has control over the NodeID corresponding to the top four bytes, so
it can ensure that the EventID not be reused.</P>

<P>The Node ID part could be e.g. from real nodes that you own. For
example, the <A HREF="examples/BlueGoldConfig.html">Blue/Gold
algorithm</A> for assigning Event IDs automatically puts the Node ID
of the first node to use that event in the Event ID, guaranteeing it
to be unique.</P>
<P>Not all Event IDs need to be assigned through that algorithm. For
example, a software configuration tool might define events and assign
Event IDs to them. A board manufacturer may prefer some other
pushbutton configuration process. A modular club may decide that
certain events form the “boundaries” of modules, and need to be
assigned well-known Event IDs to make it easier to create large
modular layouts. Whatever the method, the Event IDs need to be
globally unique, and we ensure that by requiring that people create
EventIDs using node ID numbers assigned to them (and therefore not
assigned to anybody else), plus an additional 16 bits that they are
responsible for using only once.</P>
<P>Note that the Node ID part of an Event ID doesn't have to
correspond to any physical node. So long as you've got some Node ID
address space assigned to you, you can use that. For example, a
fast-clock manufacturer might want to define a range of EventIDs so
that a different event is emitted every fast minute. (This lets e.g.
lamp controllers do day-night cycles automatically). For the sake of
argument, let's say 24 bits worth of specific events are needed (it's
actually smaller, but let's use this). The manufacturer has a large
range of node IDs assigned already, so can use 8bits worth of that
space, plus the extra 16 bits in the EventID below the
nodeID-like-part, to do this. For example, if a manufacturer had a
range of Node IDs that included at least 0x123456789A00 through
0x123456789AFF (in other words, all possible values of the low byte),
he could create a set of Event IDs with the low 24 bits used to carry
a time value:</P>

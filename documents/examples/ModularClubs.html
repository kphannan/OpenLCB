<H1 CLASS="western">OpenLCB Example: Modular Clubs and OpenLCB</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Modular clubs and their inter-club
meets present the most complex use case for OpenLCB. This note
describes some of the things they'll want to do, and how OpenLCB can
bring it about.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Goals and Requirements</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Large layouts...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Made of individual modules, and various
levels of subassemblies: multi-module yards, club layouts, etc. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Throttle controls across entire
layout...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Reduce required coordination...
Organizations like FREMO are using CAD tools, etc, to design layouts
for large meets. Connecting to those, in a flexible manner, is
important.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Desired Uses of OpenLCB</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Within a module</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Between Modules</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Discussion</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Central idea: OpenLCB is a base for
implementing solutions. How to do that need not be specified,
particularly at first.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Spanning CAN between modules to reduce
cost; provides way to create smaller module groups for e.g. club
running, etc. Universal address space means you can just wire as
needed, limited only by length and traffic.</P>
<H3>Communicating events</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Assignment of Node, Event IDs ensure
uniqueness, no overlaps or collisions. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Use of FREMO membership ID space, or
perhaps establish subspaces by club, by region, etc, to do actual
assignment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Events within modules can just be
configured in the usual way, without worrying about ID collisions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To connect modules, a modular group
could define standard “Interface Events” to e.g. tell one
module's signals that a train is approaching, or is occupying the
next block ahead; to allow control from other locations. Easy to
document these interface events at the same time as mechanical
dimensions, etc, for overall planning. For example, 0x1001 in the
low-part of the EventID could mean “Track one occupied east end”,
0x1002 could be “Track two occupied east”, with others for the
west end of the module, conveying signals status for look-ahead, etc.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Must have a way to match up the events
produced by one module with the events consumed in the next. There
are a couple of ways that this could be done:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Redefine module configuration: As
	the modules are set up, their Consumers can be configured with the
	events produced by the adjacent module. Alternately, the Producers
	of interface events can be reconfigured to produce the events
	expected by the adjacent Consumers.  This is robust and requires
	minimal communications in operation, but does require changing
	configurations.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Reconfigure via special support:
	Nodes for module interfaces could have a special configuration
	facility that makes it easy to specify just the NodeID of the
	adjacent module, automatically working out all the necessary Event
	IDs.  Or this could be a special tool that knows how to do this:
	Plug it in, ident the two nodes, and off it goes.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Conversion via separate node: E.g.
	The “Track one occupied east” event gets remapped to the
	specific event required as input in the adjacent node. Could be
	small node that does this for just one interface, or large central
	PC; can be distributed as required by other constraints.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Central monitoring</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Use of e.g. Ethernet for backbone
connecting all individual segments (as many as needed) to PCs. This
removes distance limitations, etc.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Routing protocols have to make it
possible to pull all traffic onto backbone. Not really a bandwidth
issue, Ethernet speed gets higher and higher all the time, more of a
management issue.</P>

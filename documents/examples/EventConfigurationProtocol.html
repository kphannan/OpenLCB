<H1>Event Configuration Protocol</H1>
<P>Entry-level OpenLCB users should be able to buy two OpenLCB nodes
and configure them to do something useful with only the pushbutton(s)
and LED(s) on them, without requiring a separate configuration tool,
computer, etc. 
</P>
<P>This document outlines the OpenLCB protocol for doing this. It
works without any central configuration mechanism, nor even any
global knowledge of which producers and consumers are being
configured.</P>
<P>This protocol does not mandate how a node defines its local UI.
See the separate document in “Blue-Gold Protocol” for that.</P>
<P>Nodes may also be configured using other mechanisms, including
direct loading of configuration. Techniques for that are described
elsewhere.</P>
<H2>Simplified Description</H2>
<P>Producer-nodes (ones that implement buttons, toggle switches,
BODs, etc) and consumers-nodes (signals, leds, displays, layout
lighting, etc) need to be configured to use a common EventID, such
that activating a producer will send the common EventID, which will
cause one or more consumers to activate. 
</P>
<P>The protocol uses external mechanisms, e.g. walking around and
pushing buttons, to select producers and consumers which will learn
the common EventID.  A single producer or consumer then provides the
EventID that is to be learned in a “teach EventID” message.
Specifically:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>On one or more 'learner'-nodes, select a number of
	producers/consumers (p/c's).</P>
	<LI><P>On the 'teacher'-node select the p/c which will teach the
	other nodes and activate the teaching. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>As a result, activating one of the producers will activate
	all the linked consumers. 
	</P>

<H2>Default Producer and Consumer EventIDs</H2>
<P>For reasons discussed above, it's important that the default
EventID that producers and consumers are configured to react to be
unique. This section describes how to ensure that.</P>
<P>Assume that a node can detect N conditions, each of which should
send a unique P/C Event ID (the non-unique case is discussed below).
The factory default condition is that each of those conditions will
produce a PCER message with a P/C Event ID of the board's unique NID
followed by the input number (1, 2, etc). This is enough to get the
board up and working. 
</P>
<P>For example, a board with 48-bit NID 0x123456789ABC would by
default send Event ID 0x123456789ABC001 when its first input
condition happened, 0x123456789ABC002 when its second input condition
happened, etc. These Event IDs could then be counted on for no- or
low-configuration use. 
</P>
<P>Similarly, by default a board with M consumers will start with
those consumers configured to match default EventIDs consisting of
the NID followed by a sequential number that doesn't overlap with the
producer sequence described above.</P>

<h1>Example: Network Management</h1>


"Network management" means different things to different people.
This node discusses some of these.

<p>
In general, NMRAnet does not require any central resources at run time.
(There are some centralized aspects to the allocation of Node ID numbers)
Instead, the various forms of node management can be done by one or more
nodes that implement various standard and optional interactions.

<h2>Node Monitor</h2>

A "node monitor" checks to make sure that all known nodes are reachable....

<p>
If a device wants to detect nodes that become unreachable, 
it can periodically poll nodes with a "Verify Node Serial Number".
Since every message carries the Node Serial Number of the originating
node, these polls are only required to check nodes which are not emitting
other messages within the required time interval.

<p>
No mechanism is provided to find all nodes currently reachable.

<h2>Error Logger</h2>

An "error logger" centralizes access to error information from nodes....

<h2>State Save/Restore</h2>

Provides a way to save and restore the state of all or part of an NMRAnet
installation.....

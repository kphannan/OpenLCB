<H1>Example: Fast Clocks and OpenLCB</H1>
<P>This note suggests methods for using OpenLCB to provide “fast
clock” features for a layout.</P>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>A layout control bus could do a number of useful things for
fast-time information:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Connect a number of clock displays to keep them synchronized.</P>
	<LI><P>Provide time information to plug in devices, e.g. throttles.</P>
	<LI><P>Provide  cueing for time-based occurrences, such as lights
	coming on and off, etc.</P>
</UL>
<P>Generally, fast clock systems have one unit that generates time
information, and one or more units that consume it. Some fast clock
systems track a day/date, in addition to time.</P>
<P>Fast clocks run at various rates, and can be controlled by the
user either at the generator or from other locations. Some fast clock
systems broadcast run/stop and rate information, which can also be
useful when interpolating within a fast-minute.</P>
<P>There are slightly <U>more</U> than 2<SUP>16</SUP> seconds in a
day, and just <U>less</U> than 2<SUP>11</SUP> minutes.</P>
<H2>Time as Event</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">One solution is to define a range of
events that will carry time as part of the 8-byte EventID.  If
sending minutes is sufficient granularity (its a fast clock, not a
clock clock; fast seconds are a lot of event transmissions), the 12
bits can be used for that in the 16-bit lower part of the EventID. 
The upper 6-bytes are assigned in the usual way.  
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">To make a more user-friendly format,
it's also possible to use 5 bits for hour and 6 bits for minute
separately, or arranged in bytes.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Simple nodes can then use specific
EventIDs to trigger their actions at specific times. For example,
lights in buildings in a model town can be sequenced to come on at
various times by using a standard 8-output node and configuring its
consumers to different time events.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Blue and Gold configuration can be done
by putting a programming button on the master time generator that
sends the learn message for the current clock time.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Changes to the run/stop state and clock
rate can be broadcast as separate events.  That's better than coding
them in the time events themselves, because if e.g. rate was separate
bits in the event, simple nodes could not be configured to recognize
specific times.</P>

<H1>Glossary</H1>
<P>A list of terms used in OpenLCB. 
</P>
<H2>Common Terms</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>Alias</DT><DD>
	Short form of a Node ID number which can be mapped back and forth to
	the full number. Often used as &quot;NID Alias&quot;, &quot;DID
	Alias&quot; or &quot;SID Alias&quot;&quot;, which are then written
	NIDa, DIDa and SIDa. 
	</DD><DT>
	Board</DT><DD>
	Not really something that occurs in OpenLCB itself, we need to talk
	about how the common term &quot;board&quot; maps onto OpenLCB. E.g.
	A node (board) may connect to several things (devices) on the
	layout. 
	</DD><DT>
	Bridge</DT><DD>
	Connects two OpenLCB segments with minimal changes to the content of
	the messages. For example, a bridge between two CAN segments would
	allow more nodes to be attach to the combined segments as if they
	were one; a bridge between a CAN segment and Ethernet segment would
	transform message format, but transfer every message. 
	</DD><DT>
	Datagram</DT><DD>
	The datagram protocol is a way for a OpenLCB node to efficiently
	send a short, definite-length message to another specific node. In
	that, it lies in between “event messages”, which efficiently
	sends very short event IDs to all interested nodes, and the
	streaming protocol, which sends long messages between specific
	nodes, at some cost in efficiency.</DD><DT>
	Device</DT><DD>
	Not really something that occurs in OpenLCB itself, we need to talk
	about how the common term &quot;device&quot; maps onto OpenLCB. E.g.
	A node (board) may connect to several things (devices) on the
	layout.. 
	</DD><DT>
	DID</DT><DD>
	Destination Node ID - Node ID of the node to which a specific
	message is addressed. 
	</DD><DT>
	Event</DT><DD>
	OpenLCB allows nodes to notify each other when specific &quot;events&quot;
	occur on the layout. These in turn can cause nodes to take
	particular actions. Events are not necessarily attached to a
	producer ('Button 2 pressed') or attached to a consumer ('Turn off
	light 4'), but rather to an overall state change ('Set for nighttime
	operation'). This is called a &quot;Producer/Consumer model&quot;. 
	</DD><DT>
	Event ID (EID)</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The number that identifies a specific event. OpenLCB event IDs must
	be globally unique. 
	</DD><DD>
	Events are not associated with any particular node. It may be
	convenient to use e.g. Node ID as a way of numbering them uniquely,
	but Node IDs and Event IDs are not related. 
	</DD><DT>
	Gateway</DT><DD>
	Connects two segments of the OpenLCB while translating to a
	different wire protocol. For example, a gateway can change NodeIDs
	on one side of the Router into aliases on the other side. The use of
	unique identifiers in OpenLCB is meant to reduce the need for
	gateways. They generally only appear to connect the wider network to
	a CAN link. 
	</DD><DT>
	Installation</DT><DD>
	An OpenLCB installation is the complete set of OpenLCB hardware,
	nodes, etc, that can be reached from any one of them. 
	</DD><DT>
	Node</DT><DD>
	Unit of addressibility for the network. Every OpenLCB interaction
	originates in a node. Every board that connects to OpenLCB is at
	least one node. For example, a simple turnout controller board is
	one node, while a PC with multiple programs running may contain
	several nodes. 
	</DD><DT>
	Node ID (NID)</DT><DD>
	Number identifying a specific node. OpenLCB node IDs must be
	globally unique, so they form a one-to-one mapping to the nodes
	themselves. 
	</DD><DT>
	Message</DT><DD>
	The basic unit of OpenLCB communication. 
	</DD><DT>
	MTI</DT><DD>
	Message Type Indicator - identifies a common message type. (This
	term is still under discussion) 
	</DD><DT>
	Producer/Consumer Model</DT><DD>
	A way of thinking about communications on a layout network. Events
	(unique messages on the layout network) are “produced” by some
	node(s), and “consumed” by other node(s). An event indicates
	something happened, but the corresponding messages isn't necessarily
	a status report or a command for something to change; it's just an
	announcement of the event. That event can be produced by many
	different sources (e.g. the “use passing siding” event could be
	produced by a push button at either end of the siding, or on a
	dispatcher panel), and can be consumed by several sources (it can
	turn on lamps on a panel, set turnouts in multiple places, etc).</DD><DT>
	Repeater</DT><DD>
	Connects two segments of the same type at the physical level,
	without transformation of message format. 
	</DD><DT>
	Router</DT><DD>
	OpenLCB routers forward traffic from one link to another without
	reformatting. This can be a simple as receiving on one link and
	forwarding on N, or it could involve tracking e.g. event usage and
	only forwarding needed messages. 
	</DD><DT>
	SID</DT><DD>
	Source Node ID - Node ID of the node which originated a specific
	message. 
	</DD><DT>
	Segment</DT><DD>
	Subset of an overall OpenLCB installation which is reached via one
	or more translaters and/or gateways. A segment typically uses a
	specific wire protocol. 
	</DD><DT>
	Stream</DT><DD>
	Streams are a method of moving a large number of bytes between two
	nodes. The streaming protocol defines a way to do this in OpenLCB.</DD><DT>
	Wire protocol</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Version of the OpenLCB common messages, interactions, etc adapted to
	a particular transport mechanism. Examples are the wire protocols
	for CAN bus segments and TCP/IP links. 
	</DD></DL>
<H2>
Wire Protocol Terms</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>Packet</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	A Packet is a single transmission on a OpenLCB segment. 
	</DD></DL>
<H2>
CAN Wire Protocol Terms</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>Frame</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	A Frame is packet as it is defined on the CAN bus. It consists of a
	11 or 29 bit CAN header and zero through 8 bytes of data.

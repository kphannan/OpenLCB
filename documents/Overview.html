<H1>Overview</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>NMRAnet defines a family of interoperating protocols for
controlling model railroads. It is structured around some common
concepts and separate implementations. 
</P>
<P>The NMRAnet will be capable of supporting Accessory Control,
Advanced Locomotive Control and even Multimedia and Rich Text
features on the higher bandwidth networks. This protocol proposal
will focus on NMRAnet Accessory Control with emphasis on CAN 2.0B but
allowance has to be made for simple Locomotive Control and
implementation of the NMRAnet protocol on other network technologies
like Ethernet, Internet and others. 
</P>
<P>This proposal is based on a series of <A HREF="UseCases.html">use
cases</A> that extend from a beginning modeller connecting up two
boards to a huge modular layout put together by several clubs. To
achieve this range, and to allow for future technologies, NMRAnet is
defined so that it can communicate over CAN segments, within
computers, and on network links. 
</P>
<H2>Key Features of This NMRAnet Protocol Proposal</H2>
<P>The key features of this proposal are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The basic communicating unit is
	called a &quot;Node&quot;. A node might be a single board, or a
	single program in a PC, or any other addressable item. A node may
	control any number of actual devices on a layout. Nodes exchange
	messages to control the layout. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At it's basic level, NMRAnet
	defines a transport layer for several types of data: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Events - Fixed length identifers
		that can propagate from multiple source nodes to multiple
		destination nodes. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Streams - An efficient way to
		move a large, variable number of bytes from one node to another. 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This transport level also has
	provision for interconnection of independent NMRAnet segments and
	filtering of messages to reduce traffic. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">NMRAnet defines a global set of
	common message types and their content. NMRAnet specifies how the
	common message types are to be used for standard interactions and
	optional interactions. All NMRAnet nodes must be able to properly
	take part in standard interactions that are originated from outside
	the node. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The format of the common messages
	is separately specified for each of several wire protocols. The
	initial wire protocols are CAN and TCP/IP point-to-point; additional
	ones are envisaged. NMRAnet wire protocols may define additional
	interactions and messages for specific transport-level uses, e.g.
	for housekeeping on the local connection. These interactions and
	messages will be divided into standard forms, which all nodes must
	implement, and optional forms. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The NMRAnet as a whole is
	considered as being comprised of one or more NMRAnet segments
	interconnected with bridge devices that ensure all nodes are able to
	communicate equally with all other nodes on the NMRAnet. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Every node has a &quot;Node ID
	number&quot; (NID). The assignment of the NIDs assures they are
	globally unique. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is no hierarchy of nodes or
	node aggregation or tree structures or segmentation that necessarily
	filters NMRAnet traffic. The NMRAnet is a flat structure where all
	nodes are equally accessible and addressable. (There is provision
	for gateways to acquire routing information and filter; does that
	need to be mentioned here?) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All NMRAnet nodes can see all
	NMRAnet messages (subject to optional filtering, see above). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All NMRAnet nodes on all segments
	are uniquely identified by a Node ID number and use this Node ID in
	all NMRAnet messages as a Source Node ID. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Any NMRAnet message can be traced
	back to the originator using the Source Node ID. 
	</P>

<P><I>(Section needs work)</I> 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Node ID is unique, but too
	large to carry in a CAN header. Therefore NMRAnet dynamically
	creates a seqment-unique &quot;Node ID alias&quot;, which then
	provides the necessary uniqueness to the CAN Arbitration Header to
	ensure reliable collision avoidance. No other form of e.g. priority
	bits is required to assist with arbitration of messages with
	possibly ambiguous or non-unique CAN Header bit patterns. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Where a point to point or directed
	NMRAnet message needs to be sent to a specific node the Destination
	ID field is placed in the CAN Data portion of the CAN Frame. In most
	cases, this uses the shorter &quot;alias&quot; form. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No central Network Manager is
	required, either globally or on a segment. Global network monitoring
	and diagnostics can be provided. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CAN masks/filters can still be
	applied to stream data transfers as required the combination of TYPE
	+ SRC_ID + STREAM_ID which are all in the CAN Header will uniquely
	identify an individual stream. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Event data is placed in the CAN
	Data portion of the CAN Frame.

	bytes of data per CAN Frame and a single node can source up to 16??
	different stream channels concurrently. <I>Pending implementation

	</P>
	<LI><P><I>This item needs to be rethought.</I> The SRC_ID is sticky
	in that once a NMRAnet node is allocated a SRC_ID, it should be
	stored in such a way that it can be reused for subsequent NMRAnet
	sessions. For CAN segments (particularly throttles) it will probably
	mean storing the SRC_ID along with the lcb_id in local device EEPROM
	to that for each NMRAnet segment that the throttle connects to it
	can reuse it's previously allocated address. 
	</P>
	<P><I>This part needs to be rethought.</I> Ethernet segments will
	hopefully have a DHCP server present as part of a internet broadband
	connection. These DHCP servers can usually be relied on to keep
	track of previous IP address leases based on the Ethernet MAC
	address and reissue the same IP address for subsequent IP address
	leases. For Ethernet nodes, the SRC_ID will be based on part of the
	IP address Ð probably the lower 1 or 2 bytes. This will be defined
	in the bridge(s) for that LCB/LCB_ID.

<H3>Design Considerations</H3>
<P>Networking technologies come and go and new ones become dominant.
Due consideration needs to be given to the possibility that the
current popular networking technologies of CAN and Ethernet may be
eclipsed in the future by emerging technologies like Wireless
802.15.4, FlexRay and others. The NMRAnet protocol design should
ensure that it will perform adequately on common CAN and Ethernet
(including WiFi) networking technologies, but not at the expense of
limiting its adaptation to other networking technologies, including
ones not considered now. 
</P>
<P>A critical design consideration is to allow for the addition of
newer technologies without having to discard the older technologies.
NMRAnet must be able to seamlessly add new network segments without
having to reconfigure the whole NMRAnet to accommodate the change.
Node numbers, event IDs and similar things should be portable across
the network so that topology changes are accommodated without
requiring major reconfiguration. 
</P>
<P><I>Paragraph needs to be reworked</I> The adaptation of the common
NMRAnet protocol to CAN does not try to minimise CAN message sizes at
the expense of mixing Transport and Application layer information.
This proposal errs on the side of maintaining a clear separation
between the Transport and Appliation layers to ensure ease of
bridging, tunnelling and encapsulation in other networks and reducing
the impact of protocol changes on network infrastructure devices like
bridges, repeaters, network managers and monitoring tools. 
</P>
<P>A significant design consideration for the NMRAnet has to be ease
of use for non-technical users and provision of Plug-N-Play type
features including automatic discovery and user friendly
configuration tools to assist with NMRAnet setup and configuration.
Also NMRAnet needs to support gathering of network performance
statistics to assist with performance tuning, identifying the
cause(s) of faults and performance problems. 
</P>
<P>The NMRAnet must be able to start small and grow over time as
layouts evolve. 
</P>
<H3>NMRAnet Network Topology</H3>
<P>NMRAnet is built on top of a reliable transport. This can be
either point-to-point, or multipoint.  “Reliable” transport
delivers all messages between two nodes, without changes, deletions,
duplications, additions or reorderings. No assumptions are made about
the order of communications between different nodes or node pairs.
(To allow for CAN network behavior, low priority messages may be
delivered behind higher priority messages)</P>
<P>A layout with a NMRAnet will require at least one NMRAnet network
segment. This could be CAN, Wireless, Ethernet or WiFi, but is likely
a combination of several technologies. A layout may have a lengthy
CAN based NMRAnet segment with many nodes running around the entire
layout and have a comparatively short Ethernet segment or backbone
segment that provides a convenient connection to a single PC. It is
likely that entry level NMRAnet compatible DCC Command Stations will
just have a CAN NMRAnet interface and a USB PC interface. Medium
level DCC Command Stations might add Ethernet and Wireless interfaces
whereas top end DCC Command Stations may also add WiFi. It is also
likely that manufacturers will provide various interface devices to
bridge between each of the NMRAnet segment types like CAN to
Ethernet, CAN to USB (for PC access), CAN to Wireless and Ethernet to
Wireless (for wireless throttles). Bridges to WiFi are likely to be
using consumer grade Ethernet to WiFi Access Points but some markets
may opt for a WiFi interface in the DCC Command Station. 
</P>
<P>Each segment of a NMRAnet is by default transparently connected to
all other segments. A single CAN cable would be a NMRAnet segment, as
would two CAN cables connected by a repeater. An Ethernet link would
also be a segment, as would TCP/IP network connections. 
</P>
<P>Two or more segments can be connected by bridge devices. Simple
bridge devices do not filter any messages: all messages are forwarded
to all other segments. More intelligent interconnection devices can
reduce required bandwidth by filtering messsages that are not needed
on the far side of the bridge; these are called gateways. 
</P>
<P>As an example, a CAN segment with a number of nodes can be
connected via a CAN-USB or CAN-Ethernet bridge to a PC running
several seprate control programs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As another example, a CAN segment in a
series of modules can be connected via a bridge to an Ethernet
backbone, which in turn connects via several other bridges to
separate CAN segments in other collections of modules. Several PCs
can be connected via the Ethernet and interact with all the modules
via the individual CAN segments.

<H1>Discussion</H1>
<P>Some background discussion, kept here for now. 
</P>
<H2>Event Message</H2>
<P>For monitoring purposes, it was proposed that a PCER message carry
a sequence number which increments each time the associated P/C Event
ID is sent. It is not at all clear how to do this across nodes, or
even across Producers within a single node, as there may be more than
one thing that can cause the same P/C Event ID to be sent by a single
board;. We decided this would cause more problems than it solved, and
omitted it.</P>
<P>There's not room in a CAN frame for both a destination NID and a
EID. The protocol has therefore been constructed so that any message
carrying an EID (and that isn't a datagram) is globally addressed.</P>

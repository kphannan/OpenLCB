<H1>To Do: Remaining Questions</H1>
<P>This page is a place to record issues that are still to be
resolved. This is <U>not</U> a place for recording the discussion or
decisions; once a decision is made, it should be implemented in the
documents it affects. In particular, please don't make this a list of
<U>answered</U> questions, those live in the docs we're writing. The
numbering is historical-order; please delete an item that's done, not
renumber below it, so SVN can track progress. If you want to tag
something as high-priority, please use color. Currently, “<SPAN STYLE="background: #99ccff">blue
8</SPAN>” is high-priority documentation tasks, and “<SPAN STYLE="background: #00ff00">light
green</SPAN>” is high-priority implementation tasks. (Feel free to
modify those color chooses, they were picked by a color-challenged
person)</P>
<P>12. First definition and implementation of “<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">train
control”, e.g. throttles, etc;</SPAN> define initial protocol. See
<A HREF="notes/LocomotiveControl.html">separate document.</A> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">DCC,
of course, but also allowing for other/future systems. Note that this
is separate from e.g. connections to LocoNet, XpressNet, etc. On MERG
hardware?</SPAN></P>
<P>13. Alex raised the issue of a &quot;layout ID&quot; so e.g.
portable devices (WiFi throttles) can identify which of several
layouts (e.g. at a show) should be joined. See <A HREF="notes/LayoutID.html">working
note</A>. <I>(Does this indicate need for another OpenLCB spec, for
WiFi connection and access? BobJ) (one way to solve this is with
Bonjour/ZeroConf names for access points, separate from anything
OpenLCB-specific. BobJ)</I></P>
<P>17. Still need to think more about &quot;interface Event&quot;
conventions for e.g. large modular layouts. Via XML naming? Via
EventID conventions? Goal is to link next-neighbor modules easily.
Node and Event spaces for modular clubs? [task done] Let them
allocate it using ownership mechanism. Write some examples. <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">See
examples/ModularClubs.html note.</SPAN></P>
<P>18. We plan to define a (small number) of “globally known”
events that people can use if they want to. E.g. “power down” or
“emergency stop” (See lighting item 24 below) (item done)(item
done) Document this, make it a separate note, and mention in
overviews. Document allocation mechanism (reservation mechanism) for
global, manufacturer-specific conventions. How to get those in e.g.
Blue/Gold configuration? See item 45.</P>
<P>20. Write an XML-based representation, e.g. as a separate wire
protocol for web services.</P>
<P>22. Signaling (Signalling) – see <A HREF="notes/Signaling.html">initial
Signaling design note</A>, which is currently just a placeholder.</P>
<P>23. Layout Sound Control 
</P>
<OL START=13>
	<P>Alex: (maybe just an adaptation to P/C Events but maybe should be
	identified at least) DPH: I think this is quite straight-forward. It
	includes complex nodes that can send and receive streams, or store
	the sounds, whether in real-time or not. The control of these should
	be straight-forward with events. Things like volume could use Events
	with data to set absolute levels, or increment and decrement Events.
	<I>(Need example doc for this application! - BobJ)</I></P>
</OL>
<P>24. Layout and Room Lighting Control DPH: Bob can probably fill us
in on this one ;-) as he has some experience with X10 and JMRI. Do we
need to do more than suggest some approaches? Maybe an application
note, showing how it could be done? <I>(Define some recommended
events for room intensity, e.g. how to code intensity in event space;
want a mechanism for events to drive specific pre-selected intensity;
study Insteon solution - BobJ)</I></P>
<P>37. Add a user-level introduction that talks about the user
experience, and advantages to users. This is not quite the same thing
as use cases, but those could be a starting point.</P>
<P>38. Turn the current introduction into a real geek-level document
with a consistent organization.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">45. Do we want to define some
node-specific global events? E.g. “Node has logged error”, “Node
has logged warning”; that in turn can e.g. trigger log retrieval.
Others? Can define standard events as NodeID with low of 0xFFFF, etc.
<A HREF="notes/Logging.html">This has started in the Logging note.</A>
Are there other areas that should be considered? See also item 18.</SPAN></P>
<P>47. Eventually, write some words about a recommended common log
format (mechanism is being developed in Logging note, but not format
of log records)</P>
<P>52. NodeId vs UniqueID terminology, esp. in the EventID
allocation. Notional approach:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Define a space of 48-bit unique IDs. Operationally, this
	means changing the &quot;allocating nodeIDs&quot; document to refer
	to uniqueIDs, not nodeIDs, as the unit of allocation. Require that
	every OpenLCB node be given a unique 48-bit nodeID taken from an
	assigned set of uniqueIDs. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Require that every OpenLCB producer node be given a block of
	64-bit event IDs such that the values in the most significant 48
	bits of all those event IDs lie within an assigned set of 48-bit
	unique IDs, and none of those event IDs is assigned to more than one
	node.</P>
	<LI><P>Recommend, but don't require, that nodes start assigning
	EventIDs using the uniqueID they're using as their NodeID (most
	people don't need to look at EventID numbers, but being able to
	guess where they came from can be a useful debugging hint)</P>
</UL>
<P>54. Need a CAN boot-loader/IPL process definition. May serve as a
good streaming, datagram example, but it's also possible that full
OpenLCB implementation is too much to include in a bootloader
program. “Dumbest possible node” to receive a bootload? Have a
“bootload me” standard event? “00-00” as special case.</P>
<P>55. (from the can/index.html To Do list) Need to do a lot of work
on cabling, connectors, etc at the CAN physical layer. Can we
reasonably <U>require</U> a cable implementation? Recommend one?
Document one solution? 
</P>
<P>57. (from the can/index.html To Do list) Decide on CAN
power/ground supply &amp; isolation requirements, as needed. Should
node power be available in the cable in some way? <I>(Issue of power
in a required implementation will be a contentious one. - BobJ)</I>
Even if the decision is not to have a requirement, document that.</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">59. [Task Done] Complete the
“<A HREF="notes/DisplayProtocol.html">Display Protocol</A>” note
and a sample implementation for a display, e.g. of RF or throttle
info.</SPAN></P>
<P>64. Perhaps add a simple mark/reply out-of-band signal to Streams.
Allow marking a byte as “this byte is marked” (or perhaps “last
byte moved/provided is marked”). Allow sending a no-data reply back
the other way. Useful to prevent people from trying to use buffer
size as a stand-in for e.g. record length (can't count on that size
being anything in particular anyway) Use case is for use in
bootloader.</P>
<P>67. Create [task done] a [task done] test and distribution
infrastructure for the C/C++ builds.</P>
<P>70. Native format for strings is ASCII, UTF-8 or UTF-16? <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just
one, or some way of identifying e.g. </FONT></FONT><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark"><FONT COLOR="#0842b5"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><U>Byte
Order Mark</U></FONT></FONT></FONT></A> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(BOM)?
Single bit for ASCII vs UTF-8?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>71. The examples/CrossingGateExample.html file is a funny hybrid
of general use case, and OpenLCB-specific documentation. It should
probably have the general use case aspects moved to UseCases.html,
with the specifics left in the examples/CrossingGateExample.html
file.</P>
<P>72. David Harris expressed an interest in an early email in some
standard x,y,z mapping for nodes, detectors, etc. Global and/or local
(module specific) reference frame? Make it easy to find a node in
space from it's NodeID? Is this more than just one aspect of a
general system for storing node-specific info? Is it just the
position of the node (hardware) or also items “within” the node,
e.g. the things it's connected to? Start a note....</P>
<P>74. As we write S&amp;RPs, we have to include language along the
lines of “You can't send other messages across the wire except as
defined here”. This avoids people willing the expansion space. To
make this viable, do we have to define “user expansion” message
types? On large-message formats, that's easy, as you can just prepend
a NID you own to identify that you control the message format. Harder
on CAN....</P>
<P>75. Do we need a list of “let's settle this like gentlemen”
items for NMRA 2010, e.g. to agree on CAN rates, cabling?</P>
<P>77. Finish notes/RouteCases.html doc and link</P>
<P>78. Add definition of flags (error, etc) in datagram, stream
messages in CommonMessageDefinitions.html</P>
<P>80. Discuss mechanism for removing entries from routing tables.
E.g. a router could remember the nodeIDs using a particular event,
then purge those entries if no traffic seen, no response to ping for
NN seconds. Not normative, but might be useful? Mostly for consumers;
if producer gone, doesn't produce.</P>
<P>84. Add examples to the Datagram and Stream protocol docs with
numerical CAN frames, to make the entire layout clear.</P>
<P>85. Simulate Mike Bolton's “50 segments, 100 nodes on each, P/C
32 events each” for startup and traffic.</P>
<P>86. “Ident” protocol needs development, see <A HREF="notes/IdentMethod.html">draft
note</A>.</P>
<P>89. Finish up the <A HREF="notes/RFIDusage.html">RFID note</A>.</P>
<P>90.</P>

<H1>Standard Interactions</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All nodes must be able to take part in
all standard interactions.</P>
<H2>A) Node Initialization</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Newly functional nodes, once their
start-up is complete and they are fully operational, must send an
&quot;Initialization Complete&quot; message. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is no guarantee that any
	other node is listening for this. No reply is possible. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nodes must not emit any other
	OpenLCB message before the “Initialization Complete” message.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Sending the IC message is required to
insure that higher-level tools are notified that they may start to
work with the node. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After the IC message is sent, and
before any corresponding Producer/Consumer Event Report messages are
sent, the node must identify all events produced or consumed on the
board via zero or more Identify Consumers, Identify Consumed Range,
Identify Producers and Identify Consumed Range messages. These are
not required to be in any particular order. 
</P>
<H2><A NAME="discovery"></A>B) Duplicate Node ID Detection</H2>
<P>OpenLCB nodes must have unique node IDs. To detect this across the
entire connected OpenLCB, all OpenLCB nodes must indicate an error if
they detect an incoming message with a Source Node ID equal to their
own. If possible, they should indicate it at the board itself using a
light or similar.  If possible, they should emit a PCER message with
the “Duplicate Source ID detected” global event, which will carry
the duplicate event ID in the Source Node ID field. 
</P>
<P>After sending the “Duplicate Source ID detected” global event,
the node should not transmit any further messages until reset because
this message will be received at the other duplicate-ID node(s),
resulting in additional “Duplicate Source ID detected” global
events and causing a possible message loop.</P>
<P>To further improve the reliability of this detection, OpenLCB
nodes should, but need not, emit a Verified Node ID message every 30
to 90 seconds. As an implementation detail, it's recommended that
CAN-attached nodes use their NIDa to pick that interval so that
messages don't bunch up.</P>
<H2>C) Node ID Discovery</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Upon receipt of a Verify Node ID Number
message addressed to it, or an unaddressed Verify Node ID Number
message, a node will reply with an unaddressed Verified Node ID
Number. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This can be used as check that a
specific node is still reachable. When wire protocols compress the
originating and/or destination NID, this can be used to obtain the
full NID. 
</P>
<H2>D) Protocol Discovery</H2>
<P>OpenLCB defines a number of specific protocols for interacting
with nodes, including event exchange, datagrams, streams,
configuration, etc. These protocols are optional, in the sense that
not every node will implement every one. 
</P>
<P>To determine which protocols a node implements, a Protocol Support
Inquiry message is sent to the specific node. It will reply with a
Protocol Support Reply message that contains one or more bytes of
data. A specific bit position has been reserved for each defined
protocol in a separate spreadsheet (<A HREF="ProtocolBitAllocations.ods">.ods</A>,
<A HREF="ProtocolBitAllocations.pdf">.pdf</A> form). If the bit is
zero or not present, the protocol is not supported and requests to
use it will result in a error. If present and 1, the protocol is
supported.</P>
<P>It is not necessary to check whether a protocol is supported by a
node before attempting to use the protocol. If it's not, the error
handling mechanism (see below) will indicate that.</P>
<H2>E) Error Handling</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are multiple mandatory
error-handling scenarios defined.</P>
<H3>Reject Addressed Optional Interaction</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Node A receives an addressed
	message from Node B that carries Node A's NID. 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The MTI indicates the start of an
	optional interaction. 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If Node A does not want to take
	part in the optional interaction, it may send an Optional
	Interaction Rejected message addressed to Node B with the original
	MTI in the message content. There is no requirement that OIR be
	sent; the node may silently ignore the incoming message.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The message content also contains an
optional reason code and an optional data value. The use of these
fields is to be defined. 
</P>
<H3>Reject Unaddressed Optional Interaction</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Node A receives an unaddressed
	message from Node B. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The MTI indicates the start of an
	optional interaction. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If Node A does not want to take part in
the optional interaction, it silently drops the message without
reply. 
</P>
<H3>Reject Addressed Standard Interaction Due to Error</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Node A is taking part in an
	addressed interaction with Node B. Either node may be able to send
	the next message.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some error condition prevents Node
	A from continuing the interaction. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To terminate the interaction, Node
	A sends a Terminate Due to Error message to Node B. It then resets
	it's state so as to no longer be taking part in the addressed
	interaction.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The message content contains the most
recent MTI received in this interaction, a mandatory reason code and
an optional data value. The use of these fields is to be defined.

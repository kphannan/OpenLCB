			<P>A model railroader wants to learn about NMRAnet. He buys two
			inexpensive boards at his local hobby shop. He connects them on
			his layout to two pushbuttons and a turnout motor, does a simple
			configuration, and is able to control the turnout with the
			pushbutton.

			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Alice wants to control her three
			track station. She has goes to her local store and buys one
			8-button, four turnout-controller nodes, and a power supply. When
			she gets home, she unpacks the nodes and connects each of the
			turnout-controllers to her four turnouts, E1, E2, W1, and W2. Then
			she connects the nodes together with the cables. Following the
			directions, she then uses the blue button on each of the
			turnout-controllers and ensures the attached turnout changes
			position. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now she is ready to make the buttons
			control the turnouts. The buttons are labelled A-H. To connect A
			to turnout E1, she pushes the blue button on the E1 controller
			until the turnout is in the position she wants, and then the gold
			button – this tells the controller to learn this position. She
			then goes back to the button node and pushes the gold button,
			button A, and then the gold button again. This teaches the turnout
			controller to respond to button A. She then sets E1 to the other
			position and trains it with button B. ( In more detail, on E1 she
			pushed blue repeatedly to position the turnout, then pressed gold,
			then pressed gold, B, gold on the button node). She repeats this
			with turnouts E2, W1, and W2 and C-H. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, she found that she still
			forgot to compatibly position the turnouts at both ends of the
			station occasionally. However, he realized that she could improve
			her scheme. She reset the nodes to factory settings as directed
			and then taught button A to make all the turnouts select track 1.
			(In detail: on E1 set diverge and gold, on E2 set diverge and
			gold, on W1 set diverge and gold, on W2 set diverge and gold, and
			finally on the button node pushed gold, A, and gold). She also
			made buttons B and C select tracks 2 and 3. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
			</P>
			<P>Now she could control her station tracks with only three
			buttons, and there was never a chance that they were misaligned!
			Later, she changed it again so that A-C selected tracks 1-2 for
			entrance, and D-F selected them for exit.

			<P>Alice decides that it would be nice to be able to control her

			(lets label these M-T), and hooks it to the other nodes. She then
			copies the learning from the first button node to this new one.
			(In detail: on the original set of buttons she pushed A and gold,
			and then on the new buttons she pushed gold, M and gold, and

			<P>Mike is at a loss, although he kept good records things have
			gone south on his layout. He calls up his friend and borrows his
			laptop with the NMRAnet configuration software and a NMRAnet-USB
			adapter. He plugs them into his layout LCB and turns it on. The
			program asks him to select the layout name or choose new. He
			chooses new. The program lists his twelve boards. He can drill
			down to each part of each node and see what other nodes receive
			its events. He can also see whose events it receives. There is
			also a diagram of the nodes. He pushes some buttons and watches as
			the program animates the events travelling out of one node and
			into the receiving nodes. He finds his mistake, and makes changes
			to his configuration and tests again. Problem solved – he vows
			to buy a laptop.

			<P>Large Layout Upgrade</P>

		<TD WIDTH=1011>
			<P>A model railroad has 40 NMRAnet boards controlling a large
			layout. To upgrade a major yard, the user wants to replace 12
			boards with new ones that offer new (non-NMRAnet) features. He
			captures the existing setup, replaces old boards with new ones,
			configures the equipment and is back in operation.

			<P>Joe has been assigned the non-trivial task of upgrading the
			yard with the new boards the planning committee bought. He tells
			the NMRAnet configuration program to make a fixed record of the
			configuration of the twelve boards he is replacing, and saves it
			to disk, twice, he's paranoid. He then proceeds to disconnect the
			original twelve boards and replace them with the new ones.
			Sometime later ... he brings up the configuration program, and its
			informs him there are twelve new boards on the layout. “Tell me
			something I don't know” he mutters. He brings up another copy
			and retrieves his stored configuration. He notes that some of the
			names of things have changed, but he can manage. He uses the old
			configuration to find nodes from which he can teach the old events
			from – this is easy, on the screen he just grabs the node's
			consumer or producer entry and drags it to one or more of the new
			nodes consumers and/or producers. The nodes are linked and using
			the old events. “Sweet” he thinks. Now he sets about to use
			all those new capabilities that these new nodes have – “Wow,
			it was worth it, these babies are hot”.

			<P>Mike has been operating his layout from afar using a 'glass'
			control panel on his computer connected to his layout via his Wifi
			router. However, it doesn't have the same satisfaction as having a
			real control panel. He decides to build one, and he installs a
			number of CAN NMRAnet nodes to interface it. The big day arrives
			and now he needs to configure it. He connects a CAN-to-Ethernet
			bridge and plugs it into his networks. He boots up his
			configuration program, links to the bridge and sets it up to talk
			to his layout. He then links to is layout, the program announces
			there are lots of new nodes. Using drag-and-drop he links his new
			nodes into the existing layout. This is relatively easy, as he is
			just duplicating his old controls. In fact he can just drag one
			whole old node onto a new one and all its events are duplicated.
			The whole process only took 5 minutes. Mike thinks “Now, let's
			get down to some serious operating”.

			<P>Hugh realizes he has a problem – the NMRAnet-CAN bus running
			his layout is not big enough, he's maxed out the number of nodes.
			He talks to the local guru, and the guru says – no problem, just
			cut your CAN into two parts and join the parts with a CAN-to-CAN
			bridge. Hugh is doubtful, it can't be that simple, won't he need
			to change node ids and change his event programming? The guru
			reassures him – it is that simple – no need to change
			anything, the nodes will still see alll the other nodes events,
			jyst as before. Hugh take shim at his word, picks up a bridge and,
			after five minutes deciding where to break the CAN bus, inserts
			the bridge and is running trains again.

			NMRAnet with two or three nodes controlling the module. These
			modules are separately built, with no central administration. They
			are brought to a central location for a meet, where they are all
			connected together in some pre-planned orientation. The NMRAnets
			are connected in some fashion, and used to operate the entire
			layout from both central and distributed locations.

			<P>John is in charge of the meet.  He tells the attendees to
			connect the modules together into multiple CAN segments, observing
			the limitations of length and drive capabilities of the nodes.  He
			assigns segment leaders and instructs them to configure and debug
			each segment in isolation by connecting a computer with
			configuration software.   XML files describing the modules that
			some attendees brought help in this, but the nodes themselves
			contain enough information to allow them to be connected and
			integrate their existing block detection and signalling systems.  
						</P>
			<P>If the number of modules was smaller, then John would have
			connected the segments together using CAN-to-CAN relay nodes, but
			he had decided to connect the segments together using an Ethernet
			backbone, using Ethernet-to-CAN bridges.  This will reduce the
			bandwidth requirements on each of the segments because the bridges
			will automatically only pass events between the segments that are
			actually required, rather than all packets.  Together with his
			segment leaders, they quickly integrate the segments onto the
			backbone.   Attendees can observe and control the layout from
			disparate points on teh layout.

			<P>Bob receives a call from his friend Hugh at the clubhouse that
			there's some trouble on the layout.  He doesn't have time to drive
			across town and back, but fortunately, his club has an Ethernet
			connection to the layout, and even better they have it attached to
			the local area network (LAN) and to the wider internet through
			their router – he can just log in from home!  He opens his copy
			of the configuration program on his home computer and connects to
			teh layout.  It appears that one of the signals is not responding,
			and this has lead to a cascade of failures downstream from the
			signal.  He phones Hugh back and tells him to check the
			connections on that signal.   Hugh crawls under the layout and
			discovers a plug has pulled out – it must have been that work
			party mid-week.  Everything seems back to normal.  Hugh thanks
			John.  John replies “Its all in a day's work for a OpenLCB
			repairman”.

			<P>Aggregation of Modular Clubs</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=1011>
			<P>Dozens of clubs put together dozens of NMRAnet segments and
			hundreds of modules that have been separately configured. A large
			FREMO meet would be an example. Collision avoidance: EventIds,
			NodeIds that are already configured into the modules should
			already be unique. It must be possible to build automated tools
			for translating, disambiguating Event IDs. Conventions and/or
			tools for connecting across the boundaries are needed so that e.g.
			signaling systems can work with adjacent modules they've never met
			before. It must be possible to build automated tools for health
			monitoring across the layout.</P>

			<P>See Modular Layouts.  In this case, thanks to prior planning,
			each club has provided an XML file describing the events that must
			be connected to allow the integration of the signalling and other
			systems.  Hugh and John use the configuration program to build a
			schematic diagram of the entire layout.  They then drill down to
			each interface between layout segments and connect the edge nodes
			of each segment together.  They quite quickly repeat the exercise
			on each adjacent pair of segments, with the help of the leads of
			the pairs of segments.  Since every node has a unique ID and
			unique Events, they are not worried about conflicts or having to
			change ranges of events on any modules – reprogramming hundreds
			of nodes would not be inviting.

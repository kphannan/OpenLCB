<BODY LANG="en-US" DIR="LTR">
<H1>Use Cases</H1>
<P>This page describes the use cases (stories; equipment definitions)
we use to think about tradeoffs in the proposed OpenLCB. 
</P>
<P>Note that this page is not where we document how these use cases
are achieved; that's done in Notes and Examples. 
</P>
<H2>Use Cases</H2>
<H3>Entry User</H3>
<P>A model railroader wants to learn about OpenLCB. He buys two
inexpensive boards at his local hobby shop. He connects them on his
layout to two pushbuttons and a turnout motor, does a simple
configuration, and is able to control the turnout with the
pushbutton. 
</P>
<H3>Expanding A Small Layout</H3>
<P>A user has four OpenLCB boards working on his layout. He buys one
more input board to provide extra pushbuttons to operate his yard
ladder from the other end of the layout. He's able to configure the
new board and put it into operation. 
</P>
<H3>Mid-size Layout Problem</H3>
<P>A user has twelve OpenLCB boards operating. Something changes, and
the system is no longer reliable. Certain operations no longer work,
and others only work sometimes. The user attempts some debugging
steps using features of the existing hardware, but is unable to
locate the problem, so buys/borrows diagnostic device(s). 
</P>
<H3>Large Layout Upgrade</H3>
<P>A model railroad has 40 OpenLCB boards controlling a large layout.
To upgrade a major yard, the user wants to replace 12 boards with new
ones that offer new (non-OpenLCB) features. He captures the existing
setup, replaces old boards with new ones, configures the equipment
and is back in operation. 
</P>
<H3>Relocating a Control Panel</H3>
<P>A model railroad has turnouts and signals controlled via OpenLCB.
The owner wants to move a physical control panel, currently attached
to the layout, to a new location in a separate building. The panel
will operate the layout via OpenLCB from the new location.</P>
<H3>Large Layout Expands</H3>
<P>A large model using CAN, but not any attached computers, grows
enough that it needs to have another CAN segment. 
</P>
<P>This must be possible without reconfiguring all the existing
nodes, event IDs, etc. 
</P>
<H3>Connect Multiple Programs</H3>
<P>The user wants to run multiple programs from multiple vendors in
his home computer that simultaneously connect to the layout OpenLCB
and control/monitor it. 
</P>
<H3>Remote Dispatcher</H3>
<P>A model railroad has turnouts and signals controlled via OpenLCB.
OpenLCB is used to install a CTC panel at a distant location. The
panel could be either a physical panel or on a computer screen. 
</P>
<H3>Modular Layouts</H3>
<P>A modular club has fifty modules, each of which as a CAN OpenLCB
with two or three nodes controlling the module. These modules are
separately built, with no central administration. For example, a new
member might be bringing four modules that have never run with the
club before, or a member may have just completed a couple new
modules. They are brought to a central location for a meet, where
they are all connected together in some pre-planned orientation. The
club does not want to expend any effort preallocating numbers, making
sure that module configurations conflict or anything like that; they
just want to plug together the OpenLCB CAN backbone and operate the
entire layout from both central and distributed locations. All the
modules must still continue to operate without reprogramming or
reconfiguration; there's just not enough time for that. Connections
between modules need to be added easily, either by multiple manual
operations (pushing local buttons) taking place in parallel, or
multiple computers attached to the layout with configuration tools.</P>
<H3>Remote Diagnostics</H3>
<P>A club layout is operated via OpenLCB. There's something not quite
right about the signaling, and one of the members wants to check the
operation of the signals. He makes a remote connection to the layout
and checks the status and configuration of the hardware from his home
computer. 
</P>
<H3>Aggregation of Modular Clubs</H3>
<P>Dozens of clubs put together dozens of OpenLCB segments and
hundreds of modules that have been separately configured. A large
FREMO meet is an example. 
</P>
<P>Collision avoidance: EventIDs, nodeIDs that are already configured
into the modules should already be unique. 
</P>
<P>It must be possible to build automated tools for translating,
disambiguating Event IDs. 
</P>
<P>Conventions and/or tools for connecting across the boundaries are
needed so that e.g. signaling systems can work with adjacent modules
they've never met before. 
</P>
<P>It must be possible to build automated tools for health monitoring
across the layout. 
</P>
<H2>Typical Equipment</H2>
<H3>Simple Board</H3>
<P>Low cost, low engineering complexity is important. 
</P>
<H3>Multiple I/O Board</H3>
<P>Higher cost/complexity board that can do multiple input and output
functions. 
</P>
<H3>Simple Diagnostic Tool</H3>
<P>A simple diagnostic tool that can plug into a CAN segment and
provide limited information. Not based on a computer. 
</P>
<H3>Computer-CAN Interface</H3>
<P>Inexpensive module to allow any type of home computer to attach to
a CAN segment and interact. 
</P>
<H3>Ethernet-CAN Interface</H3>
<P>Module to allow a CAN segment on e.g. a module to be connected to
an Ethernet backbone without requiring a local computer. 
</P>
<H3>CAN bridge</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Low cost module to connect two CAN
segments for greater length or more attached nodes. 
</P>

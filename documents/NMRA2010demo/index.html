<H1>NMRA 2010 Demos</H1>
<P>Brief description of proposed demos for NMRA 2010 summer meeting
with a more detailed To-Do list and notes <A HREF="todo.html">here</A></P>
<P>Constraints:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Portable</P>
	<LI><P>Limited amount of hardware available</P>
	<LI><P>Want to demonstrate real working system and hopefully knock
	their socks off...</P>
	<LI><P>Here's a link to <A HREF="#graphics6">Bob's Demo Hardware</A>
	that he will take to the Convention</P>
</UL>
<H2>Planned Demos</H2>
<H3>1) Basic hardware</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="demo1.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=693 HEIGHT=253 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Show
that initialization of multiple nodes doesn't require anything. Add
the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> node “out of box”, show that it starts up and
can be easily configured.</P>
<H3><IMG SRC="demoboards1s.PNG" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><I>Illustration
1: Two shields demonstrating Blue/Gold programming.</I><BR><BR>2)
Computer Interface 
</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="demo2.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=693 HEIGHT=488 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Add a computer via USB connection and show that everything still
works. Demonstrate computer responding to hardware events, and
hardware responding to computer events. Plan to do this demonstration
second, as the first example doesn't need a computer in any way.</P>
<H3>3) Ethernet Connectivity</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="demo3.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=704 HEIGHT=788 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Demo Ethernet connection by adding a computer via ethernet-CAN
adapter; show that's also plug-and-play.</P>
<P>Diagram shows two computers because the Ethernet connection is
added to Demo 3 without reconfiguring anything.</P>
<H3>4) Ethernet Bridging for Larger Layouts</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="demo4.png" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=756 HEIGHT=672 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Two CAN segment communicating over Ethernet without a PC doing any
intervention, e.g. for a modular layout setup. Want to script the
demo to make it clear that we're combining independent systems, which
can still interoperate.  That might need two nodes on each CAN
segment, to show they don't have to be reprogrammed.</P>
<P>Additionally, want to demonstrate filtering, perhaps by traffic
LEDs on the two networks behaving differently. 
</P>
<P>Here is a picture of Bob's “portable” Demo 4 system, which had
only 2 leaf nodes.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="demoboards.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>5) LocoNet Connectivity</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="demo5.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=745 HEIGHT=997 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Basic idea is to have LocoNet events coexist with P/C NMRAnet
events, and to move LocoNet from one place to another over an NMRAnet
backbone. May be limited by available hardware.</P>
<H2>Needed Hardware</H2>
<P>Three LEDuinos fitted out to demo I/O (at least two
switches/pushbuttons, two LEDs, a few more is better; some need
buttons/LEDs for blue/gold too)</P>
<P>Two LEDuinos with Ethernet hardware</P>
<P>Ethernet switch, cables, etc</P>
<P>One LEDunio for USB-CAN adapter (could be same as one of the
above, but better not; commercial adapter also OK)</P>
<P>Two LEDuinos for LocoNet interfaces (could be some of above;
decide whether to load new code for new function on fly during demo
or not)</P>
<P>Two passive LocoNets: cables, power</P>
<P>Two SE8c boards with LEDs (masts) and switches/buttons</P>
<P>Power supplies</P>
<P>Two sets CAN cabling</P>
<H2>Additional Demos</H2>
<P>Can we demo CBUS hardware in one of these?</P>
<P>Running “representative” signals?</P>
<P>On a demo track?</P>

<H1>OpenLCB</H1>
<H1>Producer/Consumer Event Transfer</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">OpenLCB nodes interact to control the
layout via the reporting and observation of &quot;events&quot;. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">The protocol used to transfer these
events is described here. It is built on top of the standard
interactions and messages.</P>
<H2>Event Transfer</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">OpenLCB nodes respond to local inputs
and state changes by emitting Producer/Consumer Event Report (PCER)
messages. When they do this, they are acting as &quot;Producers&quot;.
OpenLCB nodes receive these messages, and can act on them locally if
desired. If they do so, they are acting as &quot;Consumers&quot;. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">The P/C Event ID included in a PCER
message is a 8-byte unique identifier. The method for assigning these
and ensuring their uniqueness is <A HREF="EventIdUniqueAssignment.html">specified
elsewhere</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm">There are many possible ways to use
these 64 bits, some of which are discussed as examples below. In
particular, OpenLCB does not require or enforce any particular
partitioning of the eight bytes. More than one node may emit the same
P/C Event ID (note that the NID of the emitting node is available in
the message). More than one node may receive and act on a PCER
message with a specific P/C Event ID. The only requirement is that
the 8-byte quantity be unique to the event. 
</P>
<H2>Consumer Identification</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">It is useful to be able to determine
which, if any, nodes are listening for a specific P/C Event ID
message. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">This can be used as a configuration
diagnostic, and as a way of building routing tables. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">To determine which nodes are listening
for a particular P/C Event ID, a node sends an Identify Consumers
message carrying the desired P/C Event ID. This is an unaddressed
message processed by all nodes. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">All nodes that are listening for that
P/C Event ID reply with a Consumer Identified broadcast message. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">The &quot;valid&quot; bit indicates
that the node is currently in the state it would be if this message
had been received last. For example, assume a node sets its output
active for P/C Event ID 2, and inactive for a P/C Event ID 4. Then if
the output was active and the node was asked about P/C Event ID 2, it
would reply &quot;valid&quot;; if asked about P/C Event ID 4, it
would reply &quot;not valid&quot;. Depending on the node's structure,
it might not always be possible to set the &quot;valid&quot; bit with
certainty, in which case the &quot;unknown&quot; bit must be set. 
</P>
<H2>Producer Identification</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">It is useful to be able to determine
which, if any, nodes are configured to possibly emit a specific P/C
Event ID message and their current state. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">This can be used as a configuration
diagnostic, and as a way of building filtering and routing tables. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">To determine which nodes can send a
particular P/C Event ID, a node sends an Identify Producers message
carrying the desired P/C Event ID. This is an unaddressed message
addressed to all nodes. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">All nodes that are listening for that
P/C Event ID reply with a Producer Identified broadcast message. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">The &quot;valid&quot; bit indicates
that the node's internal condition is consistent with sending this
P/C Event ID. For example, assume a node sends P/C Event ID 2 when
the input goes active and P/C Event ID 4 when the input goes
inactive. Then if the input was active and the node was asked about
P/C Event ID 2, it would reply &quot;valid&quot;; if asked about P/C
Event ID 4, it would reply &quot;not valid&quot;. Depending on the
node's structure, it might not always be possible to set the &quot;valid&quot;
bit with certainty, in which case the &quot;unknown&quot; bit must be
set. 
</P>
<H2>Event Identification</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">It is useful to be able to rapidly
determine which, if any, P/C Event IDs that a particular node is
listening for and that it can emit. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">This can be used as a configuration
diagnostic. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">To determine which P/C Event IDs can
be send by a particular node, the inquiring node sends an Identify
Events message addressed to the target node. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">The node must reply with a Producer
Identified message for each P/C Event ID it can produce, and a
Consumer Identified message for each P/C Event ID for which it is
listening.</P>
<H2>Initialization and Configuration Changes</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">To ensure that event messages are
properly routed, nodes must announce when they start to produce or
consume messages. Specifically, they must do this at two times: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the node is first initialized
	and the &quot;Initialization Complete&quot; message has been sent. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When a configuration change has added an event ID that can be
	produced or consumed. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.98cm">To announce new Event IDs being
consumed, the node must transmit a Producer Identified message for
each P/C Event ID it can produce, and a Consumer Identified message
for each P/C Event ID for which it is listening.

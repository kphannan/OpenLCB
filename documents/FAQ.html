frequently asked questions about OpenLCB.</P>

subtract as discussions go on)</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Does a OpenLCB network need any central nodes
such as a network manager, configuration manager, etc?</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No. You certainly can add those if you
want, but the full capability of OpenLCB is available without them.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Can any OpenLCB node be configured to send any
event? In other words, can multiple nodes produce the same event
message?</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The message will be slightly different,
so you can tell where it comes from when debugging, but two nodes can
produce the same eventID. In that case, consumers will treat the two
messages identically.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How can two nodes send the same eventID if the
top four bytes of the eventID are required to be a valid nodeID?</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Those four bytes are the nodeID of the
node that <U>defines</U> the event, not the node that's currently
<U>producing</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"> it. The first
node to use an eventID (produce or consume) defines what it means.
Other nodes can use it without trouble. That defining node is then
reponsible for making sure that any other events it defines don't use
the same eventID. That ensures that eventIDs are always unique, and
so no reconfigurations to avoid collisions are required.</SPAN></P>

<H1>OpenLCB Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This page holds the answers to some
frequently asked questions about OpenLCB.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Some have said that the sizes of S-9.6/OpenLCB node IDs and event
IDs are too large, how do you see that?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We are specifically designing a bus for
both the present and future. We therefore believe in 'thinking big
but developing small', which means we plan for the more general case,
but implement with simpler hardware. The large IDs are designed to
let us simplify the experience for both novice and expert users by
making IDs something they do not need to worry about – they do not
need to assign them, or worry that they will conflict with someone
else's assignment. They are designed to let you operate really large
layouts without concern that you will run out of IDs. And finally, a
large event ID lets us to fold other information into it, such as
time-stamps or other buses' IDs, allowing us to bridge to them more
easily. For example, a fast-clock-node would produce events with the
fast-time embedded. Even simple nodes can use these to automate and
activate actions, without any additional code. 
</P>
<H3>But they take up too much room, and will make simple nodes too
expensive. 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Firstly, simple nodes need only a few
events, so the space taken, even at 8-bytes per event, is not
onerous. We have shown nodes that function fine on boards that cost
about $30 each retail, including USB and several layout interfaces.
It surprised us to see that even though S9.5 claims that our proposal
makes simple nodes too expensive, they have not demonstrated any
simple nodes, but rather complicated nodes. In addition, we feel that
the whole argument is rather moot – microprocessors are advancing
along Moore's Law, and already some, costing about $4 each per 100,
contain 32k of flash and 8k of RAM – so resources are hardly
limited. In many ways, having large event numbers simplifies, and
therefore reduces, the firmware required in nodes, see the fast-clock
example above. 
</P>
<H3>Why do you make such a big deal about bridging, isn't it easy? 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No, it is not easy, it's hard to do
right and even harder to do it automatically. A bunch of hand waving
about 'just bridging to other systems' is not engineering. As
everyone knows, the devil is in the details, and we have taken the
time to think though problems, and to solve them. We have chosen
solutions that scale gracefully, and that can take advantage of
commodity equipment such as Ethernet routers.</P>
<H3>Why are your answers to the NMRAnet mandate questions so much
more complicated than the other proposals? 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Stating something does not make it
true. Whether a proposal fulfills a mandate or criterion is up to the
committee, not the proposal. We believe in giving enough details that
the committee can make an informed decision, not one of faith. We
have made every effort to document and detail each of the S9.6
features. We are proposing a network that spans multiple segments on
multiple transports. In our opinion, CBUS and S9.5 basically
duplicate the capabilities of Loconet, albeit on a different
transport and at a slightly faster bit-rate. Similarly, they only
propose, at best, partial solutions to the problems facing modular
groups and museum layouts.</P>
<H3>Why include Ethernet in your proposal, isn't CAN sufficient for
large layouts? 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CAN is sufficient for many layouts, but
by no means all. CAN segments have quite strict limits on both node
counts and cable length due to bus loading, bus latency, bus
contention and ID wastage. Each segment is restricted to less than
100 nodes based on theoretical hardware drive secondary to network
capacitance. Connecting CAN segments together requires at least
active repeaters which have only limited ability to resolve bus
contention and collisions due to added latency to the network.
Un-resolved bus collisions on CAN segments are non-recoverable
errors, and active repeaters cannot prevent them. S9.6/OpenLCB uses
automatic filtering gateways and fully-unique NodeIDs to completely
prevent collisions, but even with that there will be layouts that
cannot be served only by CAN. By using a fast 'backbone' bus segment
with filtering gateways, S9.6/OpenLCB can support multiple CAN
segments, while at the same time reducing their required bandwidth.
In addition, this allows multiple software running on PCs to be
easily connected to the backbone, and to interact and control the
resulting network.</P>
<H3>Why do you use 29-bit headers and place the event IDs into the
data portion of the CAN packet, isn't that awfully wasteful of the
limited CAN bandwidth? 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For reliable operation, the CAN bus
arbitration mechanism requires that the message headers be unique;
overlapping messages cannot be reliably delivered unless they differ
in the header. OpenLCB  includes the originating unique node ID in a
29-bit CAN header to achieve this. In addition, CAN traffic is
limited by the capability of nodes to generate that traffic, and
therefore our group feels that the S9.6/OpenLCB packet-size will not
make a significant impact on the real throughput of the CAN bus.</P>
<H3>Does a OpenLCB network need any central nodes such as a network
manager, configuration manager, etc?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No, the full capability of OpenLCB is
available without them. However, you certainly can add those if you
want, and for larger networks they will be very helpful. 
</P>
<H3>Can any OpenLCB node be configured to send any event? In other
words, can multiple nodes produce the same event message?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Yes, two nodes can produce the same
event ID. The packets will not be identical, as the originating node
field in the message will be different, and therefore you can tell
where it came from when debugging, but event-consumers will treat the
two messages identically. 
</P>
<H3>How can two nodes send the same event ID if the top six bytes of
the event ID are required to be a valid node ID?</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Those six bytes are the node ID of the
node that <U>defines</U> the event, not the node that is currently
<U>producing</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"> it. The first
node to use an event ID (to produce or consume it) defines what it
means. Other nodes can use it without trouble, but the defining node
is responsible for making sure that every other event it defines
doesn't use the same event ID. This ensures that event IDs are always
unique, and therefore no reconfiguration is necessary to avoid
collisions. We should note that using the node ID is only one of the
ways to define an event ID. </SPAN>
